https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04286,Transparency & Explainability,Proximal PanNet: A Model-Based Deep Network for Pansharpening.,"Recently, deep learning techniques have been extensively studied for pansharpening, which aims to generate a high resolution multispectral (HRMS) image by fusing a low resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. However, existing deep learning-based pansharpening methods directly learn the mapping from LRMS and PAN to HRMS. These network architectures always lack sufficient interpretability, which limits further performance improvements. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel deep network for pansharpening by combining the model-based methodology with the deep learning method. Firstly, we build an observation model for pansharpening using the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) technique and design a proximal gradient algorithm to solve this model. Secondly, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a deep network, dubbed as Proximal PanNet, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Finally, all the learnable modules can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that our network performs better than other advanced methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",[],[],"['Xiangyong Cao', 'Yang Chen', 'Wenfei Cao']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15629,Transparency & Explainability,Attacking Video Recognition Models with Bullet-Screen Comments.,"Recent research has demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper, the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve about 90\% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition models, while only occluding \textless 8\% areas in the video. Our code is available at this https URL.",[],[],"['Kai Chen', 'Zhipeng Wei', 'Jingjing Chen', 'Zuxuan Wu', 'Yu-Gang Jiang']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03210,Transparency & Explainability,Model-Based Image Signal Processors via Learnable Dictionaries.,"Digital cameras transform sensor RAW readings into RGB images by means of their Image Signal Processor (ISP). Computational photography tasks such as image denoising and colour constancy are commonly performed in the RAW domain, in part due to the inherent hardware design, but also due to the appealing simplicity of noise statistics that result from the direct sensor readings. Despite this, the availability of RAW images is limited in comparison with the abundance and diversity of available RGB data. Recent approaches have attempted to bridge this gap by estimating the RGB to RAW mapping: handcrafted model-based methods that are interpretable and controllable usually require manual parameter fine-tuning, while end-to-end learnable neural networks require large amounts of training data, at times with complex training procedures, and generally lack interpretability and parametric control. Towards addressing these existing limitations, we present a novel hybrid model-based and data-driven ISP that builds on canonical ISP operations and is both learnable and interpretable. Our proposed invertible model, capable of bidirectional mapping between RAW and RGB domains, employs end-to-end learning of rich parameter representations, i.e. dictionaries, that are free from direct parametric supervision and additionally enable simple and plausible data augmentation. We evidence the value of our data generation process by extensive experiments under both RAW image reconstruction and RAW image denoising tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in both. Additionally, we show that our ISP can learn meaningful mappings from few data samples, and that denoising models trained with our dictionary-based data augmentation are competitive despite having only few or zero ground-truth labels.",[],[],"['Marcos V.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10698,Transparency & Explainability,Backdoor Attacks on the DNN Interpretation System.,"Interpretability is crucial to understand the inner workings of deep neural networks (DNNs) and many interpretation methods generate saliency maps that highlight parts of the input image that contribute the most to the prediction made by the DNN. In this paper we design a backdoor attack that alters the saliency map produced by the network for an input image only with injected trigger that is invisible to the naked eye while maintaining the prediction accuracy. The attack relies on injecting poisoned data with a trigger into the training data set. The saliency maps are incorporated in the penalty term of the objective function that is used to train a deep model and its influence on model training is conditioned upon the presence of a trigger. We design two types of attacks: targeted attack that enforces a specific modification of the saliency map and untargeted attack when the importance scores of the top pixels from the original saliency map are significantly reduced. We perform empirical evaluation of the proposed backdoor attacks on gradient-based and gradient-free interpretation methods for a variety of deep learning architectures. We show that our attacks constitute a serious security threat when deploying deep learning models developed by untrusty sources. Finally, in the Supplement we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in an inverted setting, where the correct saliency map can be obtained only in the presence of a trigger (key), effectively making the interpretation system available only to selected users.",[],[],"['Shihong Fang', 'Anna Choromanska']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04895,Transparency & Explainability,Latent Space Explanation by Intervention.,"The success of deep neural nets heavily relies on their ability to encode complex relations between their input and their output. While this property serves to fit the training data well, it also obscures the mechanism that drives prediction. This study aims to reveal hidden concepts by employing an intervention mechanism that shifts the predicted class based on discrete variational autoencoders. An explanatory model then visualizes the encoded information from any hidden layer and its corresponding intervened representation. By the assessment of differences between the original representation and the intervened representation, one can determine the concepts that can alter the class, hence providing interpretability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on CelebA, where we show various visualizations for bias in the data and suggest different interventions to reveal and change bias.",[],[],"['Itai Gat', 'Guy Lorberbom', 'Idan Schwartz', 'Tamir Hazan']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16012,Transparency & Explainability,Learning the Dynamics of Visual Relational Reasoning via Reinforced Path Routing.,"Recently, neural module networks (NMNs) have yielded ongoing success in answering compositional visual questions, especially those involving multi-hop visual and logical reasoning. NMNs decompose the complex question into several sub-tasks using instance-modules from the reasoning paths of that question and then exploit intermediate supervisions to guide answer prediction, thereby improving inference interpretability. However, their performance may be hindered due to sketchy modeling of intermediate supervisions. For instance, (1) a prior assumption that each instance-module refers to only one grounded object yet overlooks other potentially associated grounded objects, impeding full cross-modal alignment learning; (2) IoU-based intermediate supervisions may introduce noise signals as the bounding box overlap issue might guide the model's focus towards irrelevant objects. To address these issues, a novel method, \textbf{\underline{D}}etection-based \textbf{\underline{I}}ntermediate \textbf{\underline{S}}upervision (DIS), is proposed, which adopts a generative detection framework to facilitate multiple grounding supervisions via sequence generation. As such, DIS offers more comprehensive and accurate intermediate supervisions, thereby boosting answer prediction performance. Furthermore, by considering intermediate results, DIS enhances the consistency in answering compositional questions and their sub-questions.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DIS, showcasing both improved accuracy and state-of-the-art reasoning consistency compared to prior approaches.",[],[],"['Yuhang Liu', 'Daowan Peng', 'Wei Wei', 'Yuanyuan Fu', 'Wenfeng Xie', 'Dangyang Chen']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06670,Transparency & Explainability,A Causal Inference Look at Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection.,"Anomaly detection and localization of visual data, including images and videos, are of great significance in both machine learning academia and applied real-world scenarios. Despite the rapid development of visual anomaly detection techniques in recent years, the interpretations of these black-box models and reasonable explanations of why anomalies can be distinguished out are scarce. This paper provides the first survey concentrated on explainable visual anomaly detection methods. We first introduce the basic background of image-level anomaly detection and video-level anomaly detection, followed by the current explainable approaches for visual anomaly detection. Then, as the main content of this survey, a comprehensive and exhaustive literature review of explainable anomaly detection methods for both images and videos is presented. Finally, we discuss several promising future directions and open problems to explore on the explainability of visual anomaly detection.",[],[],"['Yizhou Wang', 'Dongliang Guo', 'Sheng Li', 'Yun Fu']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00508,Transparency & Explainability,Context-Based Contrastive Learning for Scene Text Recognition.,"Context-aware methods achieved great success in supervised scene text recognition via incorporating semantic priors from words. We argue that such prior contextual information can be interpreted as the relations of textual primitives due to the heterogeneous text and background, which can provide effective self-supervised labels for representation learning. However, textual relations are restricted to the finite size of dataset due to lexical dependencies, which causes the problem of over-fitting and compromises representation robustness. To this end, we propose to enrich the textual relations via rearrangement, hierarchy and interaction, and design a unified framework called RCLSTR: Relational Contrastive Learning for Scene Text Recognition. Based on causality, we theoretically explain that three modules suppress the bias caused by the contextual prior and thus guarantee representation robustness. Experiments on representation quality show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised STR methods.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11547,Transparency & Explainability,"Decompose the Sounds and Pixels, Recompose the Events.","In this paper, we propose a framework centering around a novel architecture called the Event Decomposition Recomposition Network (EDRNet) to tackle the Audio-Visual Event (AVE) localization problem in the supervised and weakly supervised settings. AVEs in the real world exhibit common unravelling patterns (termed as Event Progress Checkpoints (EPC)), which humans can perceive through the cooperation of their auditory and visual senses. Unlike earlier methods which attempt to recognize entire event sequences, the EDRNet models EPCs and inter-EPC relationships using stacked temporal convolutions. Based on the postulation that EPC representations are theoretically consistent for an event category, we introduce the State Machine Based Video Fusion, a novel augmentation technique that blends source videos using different EPC template sequences. Additionally, we design a new loss function called the Land-Shore-Sea loss to compactify continuous foreground and background representations. Lastly, to alleviate the issue of confusing events during weak supervision, we propose a prediction stabilization method called Bag to Instance Label Correction. Experiments on the AVE dataset show that our collective framework outperforms the state-of-the-art by a sizable margin.",[],[],"['Varshanth R.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13296,Transparency & Explainability,Social Interpretable Tree for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction.,"Understanding the multiple socially-acceptable future behaviors is an essential task for many vision applications. In this paper, we propose a tree-based method, termed as Social Interpretable Tree (SIT), to address this multi-modal prediction task, where a hand-crafted tree is built depending on the prior information of observed trajectory to model multiple future trajectories. Specifically, a path in the tree from the root to leaf represents an individual possible future trajectory. SIT employs a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, in which the tree is first built by high-order velocity to balance the complexity and coverage of the tree and then optimized greedily to encourage multimodality. Finally, a teacher-forcing refining operation is used to predict the final fine trajectory. Compared with prior methods which leverage implicit latent variables to represent possible future trajectories, the path in the tree can explicitly explain the rough moving behaviors (e.g., go straight and then turn right), and thus provides better interpretability. Despite the hand-crafted tree, the experimental results on ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Interestingly, the experiments show that the raw built tree without training outperforms many prior deep neural network based approaches. Meanwhile, our method presents sufficient flexibility in long-term prediction and different best-of-$K$ predictions.",[],[],"['Liushuai Shi', 'Le Wang', 'Chengjiang Long', 'Sanping Zhou', 'Fang Zheng', 'Nanning Zheng', 'Gang Hua']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06197,Transparency & Explainability,Video as Conditional Graph Hierarchy for Multi-Granular Question Answering.,"Video question answering requires the models to understand and reason about both the complex video and language data to correctly derive the answers. Existing efforts have been focused on designing sophisticated cross-modal interactions to fuse the information from two modalities, while encoding the video and question holistically as frame and word sequences. Despite their success, these methods are essentially revolving around the sequential nature of video- and question-contents, providing little insight to the problem of question-answering and lacking interpretability as well. In this work, we argue that while video is presented in frame sequence, the visual elements (e.g., objects, actions, activities and events) are not sequential but rather hierarchical in semantic space. To align with the multi-granular essence of linguistic concepts in language queries, we propose to model video as a conditional graph hierarchy which weaves together visual facts of different granularity in a level-wise manner, with the guidance of corresponding textual cues. Despite the simplicity, our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of such conditional hierarchical graph architecture, with clear performance improvements over prior methods and also better generalization across different type of questions. Further analyses also demonstrate the model's reliability as it shows meaningful visual-textual evidences for the predicted answers.",[],[],"['Junbin Xiao', 'Angela Yao', 'Zhiyuan Liu', 'Yicong Li', 'Wei Ji', 'Tat-Seng Chua']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14612,Transparency & Explainability,Pan-Sharpening with Customized Transformer and Invertible Neural Network.,"Pan-sharpening aims to increase the spatial resolution of the low-resolution multispectral (LrMS) image with the guidance of the corresponding panchromatic (PAN) image. Although deep learning (DL)-based pan-sharpening methods have achieved promising performance, most of them have a two-fold deficiency. For one thing, the universally adopted black box principle limits the model interpretability. For another thing, existing DL-based methods fail to efficiently capture local and global dependencies at the same time, inevitably limiting the overall performance. To address these mentioned issues, we first formulate the degradation process of the high-resolution multispectral (HrMS) image as a unified variational optimization problem, and alternately solve its data and prior subproblems by the designed iterative proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm. Moreover, we customize a Local-Global Transformer (LGT) to simultaneously model local and global dependencies, and further formulate an LGT-based prior module for image denoising. Besides the prior module, we also design a lightweight data module. Finally, by serially integrating the data and prior modules in each iterative stage, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a stage-wise unfolding network, Local-Global Transformer Enhanced Unfolding Network (LGTEUN), for the interpretable MS pan-sharpening. Comprehensive experimental results on three satellite data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LGTEUN compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14380,Transparency & Explainability,Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization for Unbiased Long-Tailed Classification.,"We address the overlooked unbiasedness in existing long-tailed classification methods: we find that their overall improvement is mostly attributed to the biased preference of tail over head, as the test distribution is assumed to be balanced; however, when the test is as imbalanced as the long-tailed training data -- let the test respect Zipf's law of nature -- the tail bias is no longer beneficial overall because it hurts the head majorities. In this paper, we propose Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization (xERM) for training an unbiased model to achieve strong performances on both test distributions, which empirically demonstrates that xERM fundamentally improves the classification by learning better feature representation rather than the head vs. tail game. Based on causality, we further theoretically explain why xERM achieves unbiasedness: the bias caused by the domain selection is removed by adjusting the empirical risks on the imbalanced domain and the balanced but unseen domain.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12755,Transparency & Explainability,GEQCA: Generic Qualitative Constraint Acquisition.,"The future of automated driving (AD) is rooted in the development of robust, fair and explainable artificial intelligence methods. Upon request, automated vehicles must be able to explain their decisions to the driver and the car passengers, to the pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and potentially to external auditors in case of accidents. However, nowadays, most explainable methods still rely on quantitative analysis of the AD scene representations captured by multiple sensors. This paper proposes a novel representation of AD scenes, called Qualitative eXplainable Graph (QXG), dedicated to qualitative spatiotemporal reasoning of long-term scenes. The construction of this graph exploits the recent Qualitative Constraint Acquisition paradigm. Our experimental results on NuScenes, an open real-world multi-modal dataset, show that the qualitative eXplainable graph of an AD scene composed of 40 frames can be computed in real-time and light in space storage which makes it a potentially interesting tool for improved and more trustworthy perception and control processes in AD.",[],[],"['Nassim Belmecheri', 'Arnaud Gotlieb', 'Nadjib Lazaar', 'Helge Spieker']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11386,Transparency & Explainability,Optimizing Binary Decision Diagrams with MaxSAT for Classification.,"The growing interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for critical decision making motivates the need for interpretable machine learning (ML) models. In fact, due to their structure (especially with small sizes), these models are inherently understandable by humans. Recently, several exact methods for computing such models are proposed to overcome weaknesses of traditional heuristic methods by providing more compact models or better prediction quality. Despite their compressed representation of Boolean functions, Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) did not gain enough interest as other interpretable ML models. In this paper, we first propose SAT-based models for learning optimal BDDs (in terms of the number of features) that classify all input examples. Then, we lift the encoding to a MaxSAT model to learn optimal BDDs in limited depths, that maximize the number of examples correctly classified. Finally, we tackle the fragmentation problem by introducing a method to merge compatible subtrees for the BDDs found via the MaxSAT model. Our empirical study shows clear benefits of the proposed approach in terms of prediction quality and intrepretability (i.e., lighter size) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",[],[],"['Hao Hu', 'Marie-José Huguet', 'Mohamed Siala']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11527,Transparency & Explainability,Subspace Differential Privacy.,"Many data applications have certain invariant constraints due to practical needs. Data curators who employ differential privacy need to respect such constraints on the sanitized data product as a primary utility requirement. Invariants challenge the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of privacy guarantees. We propose subspace differential privacy, to honestly characterize the dependence of the sanitized output on confidential aspects of the data. We discuss two design frameworks that convert well-known differentially private mechanisms, such as the Gaussian and the Laplace mechanisms, to subspace differentially private ones that respect the invariants specified by the curator. For linear queries, we discuss the design of near-optimal mechanisms that minimize the mean squared error. Subspace differentially private mechanisms rid the need for post-processing due to invariants, preserve transparency and statistical intelligibility of the output, and can be suitable for distributed implementation. We showcase the proposed mechanisms on the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance demonstration data, and a spatio-temporal dataset of mobile access point connections on a large university campus.",[],[],"['Jie Gao', 'Ruobin Gong', 'Fang-Yi Yu']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00225,Transparency & Explainability,STDEN: Towards Physics-Guided Neural Networks for Traffic Flow Prediction.,"High-performance traffic flow prediction model designing, a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, is a long-standing but still challenging task for industrial and academic communities. The lack of integration between physical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting the development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can usually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow systems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially deep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but can not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge the gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a physics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation Network (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics into a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow on road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows are driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process of the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs both the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability of physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model. Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. A case study further verifies that STDEN can capture the mechanism of urban traffic and generate accurate predictions with physical meaning. The proposed framework of differential equation network modeling may also cast light on other similar applications.",[],[],"['Jiahao Ji', 'Jingyuan Wang', 'Zhe Jiang', 'Jiawei Jiang', 'Hu Zhang']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08025,Transparency & Explainability,TLogic: Temporal Logical Rules for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Knowledge Graphs.,"Conventional static knowledge graphs model entities in relational data as nodes, connected by edges of specific relation types. However, information and knowledge evolve continuously, and temporal dynamics emerge, which are expected to influence future situations. In temporal knowledge graphs, time information is integrated into the graph by equipping each edge with a timestamp or a time range. Embedding-based methods have been introduced for link prediction on temporal knowledge graphs, but they mostly lack explainability and comprehensible reasoning chains. Particularly, they are usually not designed to deal with link forecasting -- event prediction involving future timestamps. We address the task of link forecasting on temporal knowledge graphs and introduce TLogic, an explainable framework that is based on temporal logical rules extracted via temporal random walks. We compare TLogic with state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets and show better overall performance while our method also provides explanations that preserve time consistency. Furthermore, in contrast to most state-of-the-art embedding-based methods, TLogic works well in the inductive setting where already learned rules are transferred to related datasets with a common vocabulary.",[],[],"['Yushan Liu', 'Yunpu Ma', 'Marcel Hildebrandt', 'Mitchell Joblin', 'Volker Tresp']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12524,Transparency & Explainability,Discovering Interpretable Data-to-Sequence Generators.,"Deep learning continues to revolutionize an ever-growing number of critical application areas including healthcare, transportation, finance, and basic sciences. Despite their increased predictive power, model transparency and human explainability remain a significant challenge due to the ""black box"" nature of modern deep learning models. In many cases the desired balance between interpretability and performance is predominately task specific. Human-centric domains such as healthcare necessitate a renewed focus on understanding how and why these frameworks are arriving at critical and potentially life-or-death decisions. Given the quantity of research and empirical successes of deep learning for computer vision, most of the existing interpretability research has focused on image processing techniques. Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning frameworks using sequential data. Given recent deep learning advancements in highly sequential domains such as natural language processing and physiological signal processing, the need for deep sequential explanations is at an all-time high. In this paper, we review current techniques for interpreting deep learning techniques involving sequential data, identify similarities to non-sequential methods, and discuss current limitations and future avenues of sequential interpretability research.",[],[],"['Benjamin Shickel', 'Parisa Rashidi']",[],[]

We survey methods that underly geometric relational embeddings and categorize them based on (i) the embedding geometries that are used to represent the data; and (ii) the relational reasoning tasks that they aim to improve.

While explaining choices made by black-box algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning has occupied most of the limelight, systems that attempt to explain decisions (even simple ones) in the context of social choice are steadily catching up. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of explainability in mechanism design, a domain characterized by economically motivated agents and often having no single choice that maximizes all individual utility functions.

Counterfactual explanations can help users understand not only why ML models make certain decisions, but also how these decisions can be changed. We frame the problem of finding counterfactual explanations as a gradient-based optimization task and extend previous work that could only be applied to differentiable models. In order to accommodate non-differentiable models such as tree ensembles, we use probabilistic model approximations in the optimization framework. We introduce an approximation technique that is effective for finding counterfactual explanations for predictions of the original model and show that our counterfactual examples are significantly closer to the original instances than those produced by other methods specifically designed for tree ensembles.",[],[],"['Ana Lucic', 'Harrie Oosterhuis', 'Hinda Haned', 'Maarten de Rijke']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01155,Transparency & Explainability,DeepVisualInsight: Time-Travelling Visualization for Spatio-Temporal Causality of Deep Classification Training.,"Understanding how the predictions of deep learning models are formed during the training process is crucial to improve model performance and fix model defects, especially when we need to investigate nontrivial training strategies such as active learning, and track the root cause of unexpected training results such as performance degeneration. In this work, we propose a time-travelling visual solution DeepVisualInsight (DVI), aiming to manifest the spatio-temporal causality while training a deep learning image classifier. The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional space. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most important information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal analyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline approaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the spatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency. Moreover, our case study shows that our visual solution can well reflect the characteristics of various training scenarios, showing good potential of DVI as a debugging tool for analyzing deep learning training processes.",[],[],"['Xianglin Yang', 'Yun Lin', 'Ruofan Liu', 'Zhenfeng He', 'Chao Wang', 'Jin Song Dong', 'Hong Mei']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05276,Transparency & Explainability,Trading Complexity for Sparsity in Random Forest Explanations.,"Random forests have long been considered as powerful model ensembles in machine learning. By training multiple decision trees, whose diversity is fostered through data and feature subsampling, the resulting random forest can lead to more stable and reliable predictions than a single decision tree. This however comes at the cost of decreased interpretability: while decision trees are often easily interpretable, the predictions made by random forests are much more difficult to understand, as they involve a majority vote over hundreds of decision trees. In this paper, we examine different types of reasons that explain ""why"" an input instance is classified as positive or negative by a Boolean random forest. Notably, as an alternative to sufficient reasons taking the form of prime implicants of the random forest, we introduce majoritary reasons which are prime implicants of a strict majority of decision trees. For these different abductive explanations, the tractability of the generation problem (finding one reason) and the minimization problem (finding one shortest reason) are investigated. Experiments conducted on various datasets reveal the existence of a trade-off between runtime complexity and sparsity. Sufficient reasons - for which the identification problem is DP-complete - are slightly larger than majoritary reasons that can be generated using a simple linear- time greedy algorithm, and significantly larger than minimal majoritary reasons that can be approached using an anytime P ARTIAL M AX SAT algorithm.",[],[],"['Gilles Audemard', 'Steve Bellart', 'Louenas Bounia', 'Frédéric Koriche', 'Jean-Marie Lagniez', 'Pierre Marquis']",[],[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06804,Transparency & Explainability,Entropy-Based Logic Explanations of Neural Networks.,"Explainable artificial intelligence has rapidly emerged since lawmakers have started requiring interpretable models for safety-critical domains. Concept-based neural networks have arisen as explainable-by-design methods as they leverage human-understandable symbols (i.e. concepts) to predict class memberships. However, most of these approaches focus on the identification of the most relevant concepts but do not provide concise, formal explanations of how such concepts are leveraged by the classifier to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable approach enabling the extraction of logic explanations from neural networks using the formalism of First-Order Logic.

We propose to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure exploration problem in multi-armed bandits.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00411,Transparency & Explainability,Disentangled Spatiotemporal Graph Generative Models.,"Spatiotemporal graph represents a crucial data structure where the nodes and edges are embedded in a geometric space and can evolve dynamically over time. Nowadays, spatiotemporal graph data is becoming increasingly popular and important, ranging from microscale (e.g. protein folding), to middle-scale (e.g. dynamic functional connectivity), to macro-scale (e.g. human mobility network). Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among spatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in network science, they typically rely on network processing hypothesized by human knowledge. This usually fit well towards the graph properties which can be predefined, but cannot do well for the most cases, especially for many key domains where the human has yet very limited knowledge such as protein folding and biological neuronal networks. In this paper, we aim at pushing forward the modeling and understanding of spatiotemporal graphs via new disentangled deep generative models. Specifically, a new Bayesian model is proposed that factorizes spatiotemporal graphs into spatial, temporal, and graph factors as well as the factors that explain the interplay among them. A variational objective function and new mutual information thresholding algorithms driven by information bottleneck theory have been proposed to maximize the disentanglement among the factors with theoretical guarantees. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-arts by up to 69.2% for graph generation and 41.5% for interpretability.",[],[],"['Yuanqi Du', 'Xiaojie Guo', 'Hengning Cao', 'Yanfang Ye', 'Liang Zhao']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00491,Transparency & Explainability,KerGNNs: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks with Graph Kernels.,"Graph kernels are historically the most widely-used technique for graph classification tasks. However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models.",[],[],"['Aosong Feng', 'Chenyu You', 'Shiqiang Wang', 'Leandros Tassiulas']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07493,Transparency & Explainability,Algorithmic Concept-Based Explainable Reasoning.,"Recent research on graph neural network (GNN) models successfully applied GNNs to classical graph algorithms and combinatorial optimisation problems. This has numerous benefits, such as allowing applications of algorithms when preconditions are not satisfied, or reusing learned models when sufficient training data is not available or can't be generated. Unfortunately, a key hindrance of these approaches is their lack of explainability, since GNNs are black-box models that cannot be interpreted directly. In this work, we address this limitation by applying existing work on concept-based explanations to GNN models. We introduce concept-bottleneck GNNs, which rely on a modification to the GNN readout mechanism. Using three case studies we demonstrate that: (i) our proposed model is capable of accurately learning concepts and extracting propositional formulas based on the learned concepts for each target class; (ii) our concept-based GNN models achieve comparative performance with state-of-the-art models; (iii) we can derive global graph concepts, without explicitly providing any supervision on graph-level concepts.",[],[],"['Dobrik Georgiev', 'Pietro Barbiero', 'Dmitry Kazhdan', 'Petar Veličković', 'Pietro Liò']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15745,Transparency & Explainability,Reinforcement Learning of Causal Variables Using Mediation Analysis.,"Many open problems in machine learning are intrinsically related to causality, however, the use of causal analysis in machine learning is still in its early stage. Within a general reinforcement learning setting, we consider the problem of building a general reinforcement learning agent which uses experience to construct a causal graph of the environment, and use this graph to inform its policy. Our approach has three characteristics: First, we learn a simple, coarse-grained causal graph, in which the variables reflect states at many time instances, and the interventions happen at the level of policies, rather than individual actions. Secondly, we use mediation analysis to obtain an optimization target. By minimizing this target, we define the causal variables. Thirdly, our approach relies on estimating conditional expectations rather the familiar expected return from reinforcement learning, and we therefore apply a generalization of Bellman's equations. We show the method can learn a plausible causal graph in a grid-world environment, and the agent obtains an improvement in performance when using the causally informed policy. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply causal analysis in a reinforcement learning setting without strict restrictions on the number of states. We have observed that mediation analysis provides a promising avenue for transforming the problem of causal acquisition into one of cost-function minimization, but importantly one which involves estimating conditional expectations. This is a new challenge, and we think that causal reinforcement learning will involve development methods suited for online estimation of such conditional expectations. Finally, a benefit of our approach is the use of very simple causal models, which are arguably a more natural model of human causal understanding.",[],[],"['Tue Herlau', 'Rasmus Larsen']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06124,Transparency & Explainability,Causal Discovery in Hawkes Processes by Minimum Description Length.,"Hawkes processes are a special class of temporal point processes which exhibit a natural notion of causality, as occurrence of events in the past may increase the probability of events in the future. Discovery of the underlying influence network among the dimensions of multi-dimensional temporal processes is of high importance in disciplines where a high-frequency data is to model, e.g. in financial data or in seismological data. This paper approaches the problem of learning Granger-causal network in multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. We formulate this problem as a model selection task in which we follow the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Moreover, we propose a general algorithm for MDL-based inference using a Monte-Carlo method and we use it for our causal discovery problem. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on synthetic and real-world financial data.

Recent research shows that embedding symbolic knowledge into DRL is promising in addressing those challenges. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework with symbolic options. Our framework features a loop training procedure, which enables guiding the improvement of policy by planning with planning models (including action models and hierarchical task network models) and symbolic options learned from interactive trajectories automatically. The learned symbolic options alleviate the dense requirement of expert domain knowledge and provide inherent interpretability of policies. Moreover, the transferability and data efficiency can be further improved by planning with the symbolic planning models. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct experiments on two domains, Montezuma's Revenge and Office World, respectively.

Existing methods disentangle multi-view representations into consistent and view-specific representations by introducing strong inductive biases, which can limit their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view representation disentangling method that aims to go beyond inductive biases, ensuring both interpretability and generalizability of the resulting representations. Our method is based on the observation that discovering multi-view consistency in advance can determine the disentangling information boundary, leading to a decoupled learning objective. We also found that the consistency can be easily extracted by maximizing the transformation invariance and clustering consistency between views. These observations drive us to propose a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we obtain multi-view consistency by training a consistent encoder to produce semantically-consistent representations across views as well as their corresponding pseudo-labels. In the second stage, we disentangle specificity from comprehensive representations by minimizing the upper bound of mutual information between consistent and comprehensive representations. Finally, we reconstruct the original data by concatenating pseudo-labels and view-specific representations. Our experiments on four multi-view datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms 12 comparison methods in terms of clustering and classification performance. The visualization results also show that the extracted consistency and specificity are compact and interpretable.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09744,Transparency & Explainability,Covered Information Disentanglement: Model Transparency via Unbiased Permutation Importance.,"Model transparency is a prerequisite in many domains and an increasingly popular area in machine learning research. In the medical domain, for instance, unveiling the mechanisms behind a disease often has higher priority than the diagnostic itself since it might dictate or guide potential treatments and research directions. One of the most popular approaches to explain model global predictions is the permutation importance where the performance on permuted data is benchmarked against the baseline. However, this method and other related approaches will undervalue the importance of a feature in the presence of covariates since these cover part of its provided information. To address this issue, we propose Covered Information Disentanglement (CID), a method that considers all feature information overlap to correct the values provided by permutation importance. We further show how to compute CID efficiently when coupled with Markov random fields. We demonstrate its efficacy in adjusting permutation importance first on a controlled toy dataset and discuss its effect on real-world medical data.",[],[],"['João Pereira', 'Erik S.G.

Initially consisting of unsupervised models with independence assumptions, more recently, weak supervision and correlated features have been explored, but without a causal view of the generative process. In contrast, we work under the regime of a causal generative process where generative factors are either independent or can be potentially confounded by a set of observed or unobserved confounders. We present an analysis of disentangled representations through the notion of disentangled causal process. We motivate the need for new metrics and datasets to study causal disentanglement and propose two evaluation metrics and a dataset. We show that our metrics capture the desiderata of disentangled causal process.

Our objective is to forecast sepsis patient outcomes using their medical history and treatments, while learning interpretable state representations to assess patients' risks in developing various adverse outcomes.

In this work, we use knowledge distillation via constrained variational inference to distill the knowledge of a powerful ""teacher"" neural network model with high predictive power to train a ""student"" latent variable model to learn interpretable hidden state representations to achieve high predictive performance for sepsis outcome prediction. Using real-world data from the MIMIC-IV database, we trained an LSTM as the ""teacher"" model to predict mortality for sepsis patients, given information about their recent history of vital signs, lab values and treatments. For our student model, we use an autoregressive hidden Markov model (AR-HMM) to learn interpretable hidden states from patients' clinical time series, and use the posterior distribution of the learned state representations to predict various downstream outcomes, including hospital mortality, pulmonary edema, need for diuretics, dialysis, and mechanical ventilation.

We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the general US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time.

The fact that post-hoc methods fail to reveal the original reasoning process of GNNs raises the need of building GNNs with built-in interpretability. In this work, we propose Prototype Graph Neural Network (ProtGNN), which combines prototype learning with GNNs and provides a new perspective on the explanations of GNNs. In ProtGNN, the explanations are naturally derived from the case-based reasoning process and are actually used during classification. The prediction of ProtGNN is obtained by comparing the inputs to a few learned prototypes in the latent space. Furthermore, for better interpretability and higher efficiency, a novel conditional subgraph sampling module is incorporated to indicate which part of the input graph is most similar to each prototype in ProtGNN+.

The key insight of LOREN is to represent claim phrase veracity as three-valued latent variables, which are regularized by aggregation logical rules. The final claim verification is based on all latent variables. Thus, LOREN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability -- it is easy to explain how it reaches certain results with claim phrase veracity.

However, previous research has shown that there is no clear best scoring method across various text classification tasks while practitioners typically have to make several other ad-hoc choices regarding the length and the type of the rationale (e.g. short or long, contiguous or not). Inspired by this, we propose a simple yet effective and flexible method that allows selecting optimally for each data instance: (1) a feature scoring method; (2) the length; and (3) the type of the rationale. Our method is inspired by input erasure approaches to interpretability which assume that the most faithful rationale for a prediction should be the one with the highest difference between the model's output distribution using the full text and the text after removing the rationale as input respectively. Evaluation on four standard text classification datasets shows that our proposed method provides more faithful, comprehensive and highly sufficient explanations compared to using a fixed feature scoring method, rationale length and type.

However, previous works usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales for explainability while being beneficial to prediction; ii) how to make the predictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively, a model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against adversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs explanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end, we propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC. It includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to use various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the model's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate rationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information. Performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC outperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a large margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the attack success rate effectively by up to 69%.

Specifically, many clinical deep learning models lack rigorous and robust techniques for conveying certainty (or lack thereof) in their predictions -- ultimately limiting their appeal for extensive use in medical decision-making. Furthermore, numerous demonstrations of algorithmic bias have increased hesitancy towards deployment of deep learning for clinical applications. To this end, we explore how conformal predictions can complement existing deep learning approaches by providing an intuitive way of expressing uncertainty while facilitating greater transparency to clinical users. In this paper, we conduct field interviews with radiologists to assess possible use-cases for conformal predictors. Using insights gathered from these interviews, we devise two clinical use-cases and empirically evaluate several methods of conformal predictions on a dermatology photography dataset for skin lesion classification. We show how to modify conformal predictions to be more adaptive to subgroup differences in patient skin tones through equalized coverage. Finally, we compare conformal prediction against measures of epistemic uncertainty.",[],[],"['Charles Lu', 'Andreanne Lemay', 'Ken Chang', 'Katharina Hoebel', 'Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer']",[],[]

To enable better decision-making especially for demand flexibility of the end-user, it is necessary to provide not only accurate but also understandable and actionable forecasts. To provide accurate forecasts Global Forecasting Models (GFM) trained across time series have shown superior results in many demand forecasting competitions and real-world applications recently, compared with univariate forecasting approaches. We aim to fill the gap between the accuracy and the interpretability in global forecasting approaches. In order to explain the global model forecasts, we propose Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Rule-based Explanations for Forecasting (LIMREF), a local explainer framework that produces k-optimal impact rules for a particular forecast, considering the global forecasting model as a black-box model, in a model-agnostic way. It provides different types of rules that explain the forecast of the global model and the counterfactual rules, which provide actionable insights for potential changes to obtain different outputs for given instances. We conduct experiments using a large-scale electricity demand dataset with exogenous features such as temperature and calendar effects. Here, we evaluate the quality of the explanations produced by the LIMREF framework in terms of both qualitative and quantitative aspects such as accuracy, fidelity, and comprehensibility and benchmark those against other local explainers.",[],[],"['Dilini Rajapaksha', 'Christoph Bergmeir']",[],[]

Current manual forest carbon stock inventory methods of measuring single trees by hand are time, labour, and cost-intensive and have been shown to be subjective. They can lead to substantial overestimation of the carbon stock and ultimately distrust in forest financing. The potential for impact and scale of leveraging advancements in machine learning and remote sensing technologies is promising but needs to be of high quality in order to replace the current forest stock protocols for certifications. In this paper, we present ReforesTree, a benchmark dataset of forest carbon stock in six agro-forestry carbon offsetting sites in Ecuador. Furthermore, we show that a deep learning-based end-to-end model using individual tree detection from low cost RGB-only drone imagery is accurately estimating forest carbon stock within official carbon offsetting certification standards. Additionally, our baseline CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art satellite-based forest biomass and carbon stock estimates for this type of small-scale, tropical agro-forestry sites. We present this dataset to encourage machine learning research in this area to increase accountability and transparency of monitoring, verification and reporting (MVR) in carbon offsetting projects, as well as scaling global reforestation financing through accurate remote sensing.",[],[],"['Gyri Reiersen', 'David Dao', 'Björn Lütjens', 'Konstantin Klemmer', 'Kenza Amara', 'Attila Steinegger', 'Ce Zhang', 'Xiaoxiang Zhu']",[],[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11209,Transparency & Explainability,Interpretable Knowledge Tracing: Simple and Efficient Student Modeling with Causal Relations.,"Intelligent Tutoring Systems have become critically important in future learning environments. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system. It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models. However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical in learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID and student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent features from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining techniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a simple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem difficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are easier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows better student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction. Thus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized instructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems.",[],[],"['Sein Minn', 'Jill-Jenn Vie', 'Koh Takeuchi', 'Hisashi Kashima', 'Feida Zhu']",[],[]

Extreme events such as heat and cold waves, droughts, heavy rain and storms are particularly challenging to predict accurately due to their rarity and non-linear chaotic nature, and because of model limitations. However, recent studies have shown that predictive skill of extremes can be increased when using more sophisticated approaches, indicating that there might be systemic predictability that is not being leveraged. Recently, numerous studies have been devoted to the exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to study the predictability and make predictions of weather and climate. AI techniques have shown great potential to improve the prediction of extreme events and uncover their links to large-scale and local drivers. Machine and deep learning, causal discovery, explainable AI, are only some of the approaches that have been tested to both improve our understanding of the processes underlying predictability and enhance prediction skill of extreme events. Results are promising, especially for hybrid predictions that combine the AI, which can reveal and exploit unknown spatio-temporal connections from data, and climate models, that provide the theoretical foundation and interpretability of the physical world.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03943,Transparency & Explainability,Mutual Understanding in Human-Machine Teaming.,"Recent advances in machine learning have led to growing interest in Explainable AI (xAI) to enable humans to gain insight into the decision-making of machine learning models. Despite this recent interest, the utility of xAI techniques has not yet been characterized in human-machine teaming. Importantly, xAI offers the promise of enhancing team situational awareness (SA) and shared mental model development, which are the key characteristics of effective human-machine teams. Rapidly developing such mental models is especially critical in ad hoc human-machine teaming, where agents do not have a priori knowledge of others' decision-making strategies. In this paper, we present two novel human-subject experiments quantifying the benefits of deploying xAI techniques within a human-machine teaming scenario. First, we show that xAI techniques can support SA ($p<0.05)$. Second, we examine how different SA levels induced via a collaborative AI policy abstraction affect ad hoc human-machine teaming performance. Importantly, we find that the benefits of xAI are not universal, as there is a strong dependence on the composition of the human-machine team. Novices benefit from xAI providing increased SA ($p<0.05$) but are susceptible to cognitive overhead ($p<0.05$). On the other hand, expert performance degrades with the addition of xAI-based support ($p<0.05$), indicating that the cost of paying attention to the xAI outweighs the benefits obtained from being provided additional information to enhance SA. Our results demonstrate that researchers must deliberately design and deploy the right xAI techniques in the right scenario by carefully considering human-machine team composition and how the xAI method augments SA.",[],[],"['Rohan Paleja', 'Muyleng Ghuy', 'Nadun Ranawaka Arachchige', 'Reed Jensen', 'Matthew Gombolay']",[],[]

Automatically finding the optimal prompt for each task, however, is challenging. Most existing work resorts to tuning soft prompt (e.g., embeddings) which falls short of interpretability, reusability across LMs, and applicability when gradients are not accessible. Discrete prompt, on the other hand, is difficult to optimize, and is often created by ""enumeration (e.g., paraphrasing)-then-selection"" heuristics that do not explore the prompt space systematically. This paper proposes RLPrompt, an efficient discrete prompt optimization approach with reinforcement learning (RL). RLPrompt formulates a parameter-efficient policy network that generates the desired discrete prompt after training with reward. To overcome the complexity and stochasticity of reward signals by the large LM environment, we incorporate effective reward stabilization that substantially enhances the training efficiency. RLPrompt is flexibly applicable to different types of LMs, such as masked (e.g., BERT) and left-to-right models (e.g., GPTs), for both classification and generation tasks. Experiments on few-shot classification and unsupervised text style transfer show superior performance over a wide range of existing finetuning or prompting methods. Interestingly, the resulting optimized prompts are often ungrammatical gibberish text; and surprisingly, those gibberish prompts are transferrable between different LMs to retain significant performance, indicating LM prompting may not follow human language patterns.",[],[],"['Mingkai Deng', 'Jianyu Wang', 'Cheng-Ping Hsieh', 'Yihan Wang', 'Han Guo', 'Tianmin Shu', 'Meng Song', 'Eric P.

In this paper, we propose a dual-branch federative magnitude and phase estimation framework, dubbed DBT-Net, for monaural speech enhancement, aiming at recovering the coarse- and fine-grained regions of the overall spectrum in parallel. From the complementary perspective, the magnitude estimation branch is designed to filter out dominant noise components in the magnitude domain, while the complex spectrum purification branch is elaborately designed to inpaint the missing spectral details and implicitly estimate the phase information in the complex-valued spectral domain. To facilitate the information flow between each branch, interaction modules are introduced to leverage features learned from one branch, so as to suppress the undesired parts and recover the missing components of the other branch. Instead of adopting the conventional RNNs and temporal convolutional networks for sequence modeling, we employ a novel attention-in-attention transformer-based network within each branch for better feature learning. More specially, it is composed of several adaptive spectro-temporal attention transformer-based modules and an adaptive hierarchical attention module, aiming to capture long-term time-frequency dependencies and further aggregate intermediate hierarchical contextual information.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09300,Fairness & Bias,Towards End-to-End Image Compression and Analysis with Transformers.,"We propose an end-to-end image compression and analysis model with Transformers, targeting to the cloud-based image classification application. Instead of placing an existing Transformer-based image classification model directly after an image codec, we aim to redesign the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to perform image classification from the compressed features and facilitate image compression with the long-term information from the Transformer. Specifically, we first replace the patchify stem (i.e., image splitting and embedding) of the ViT model with a lightweight image encoder modelled by a convolutional neural network. The compressed features generated by the image encoder are injected convolutional inductive bias and are fed to the Transformer for image classification bypassing image reconstruction. Meanwhile, we propose a feature aggregation module to fuse the compressed features with the selected intermediate features of the Transformer, and feed the aggregated features to a deconvolutional neural network for image reconstruction. The aggregated features can obtain the long-term information from the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and improve the compression performance. The rate-distortion-accuracy optimization problem is finally solved by a two-step training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both the image compression and the classification tasks.",[],[],"['Yuanchao Bai', 'Xu Yang', 'Xianming Liu', 'Junjun Jiang', 'Yaowei Wang', 'Xiangyang Ji', 'Wen Gao']",[],[]

That is, a CNN has an inductive bias to naturally focus on objects, named as Tobias (""The object is at sight"") in this paper. This empirical inductive bias is further analyzed and successfully applied to self-supervised learning (SSL). A CNN is encouraged to learn representations that focus on the foreground object, by transforming every image into various versions with different backgrounds, where the foreground and background separation is guided by Tobias. Experimental results show that the proposed Tobias significantly improves downstream tasks, especially for object detection. This paper also shows that Tobias has consistent improvements on training sets of different sizes, and is more resilient to changes in image augmentations.

However, current SGG methods usually suffer from sub-optimal scene graph generation because of the long-tailed distribution of training data. To address this problem, we propose Resistance Training using Prior Bias (RTPB) for the scene graph generation. Specifically, RTPB uses a distributed-based prior bias to improve models' detecting ability on less frequent relationships during training, thus improving the model generalizability on tail categories. In addition, to further explore the contextual information of objects and relationships, we design a contextual encoding backbone network, termed as Dual Transformer (DTrans). We perform extensive experiments on a very popular benchmark, VG150, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the unbiased scene graph generation. In specific, our RTPB achieves an improvement of over 10% under the mean recall when applied to current SGG methods. Furthermore, DTrans with RTPB outperforms nearly all state-of-the-art methods with a large margin.",[],[],"['Chao Chen', 'Yibing Zhan', 'Baosheng Yu', 'Liu Liu', 'Yong Luo', 'Bo Du']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03612,Fairness & Bias,DCAN: Improving Temporal Action Detection via Dual Context Aggregation.,"Temporal action detection aims to locate the boundaries of action in the video. The current method based on boundary matching enumerates and calculates all possible boundary matchings to generate proposals. However, these methods neglect the long-range context aggregation in boundary prediction. At the same time, due to the similar semantics of adjacent matchings, local semantic aggregation of densely-generated matchings cannot improve semantic richness and discrimination. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end proposal generation method named Dual Context Aggregation Network (DCAN) to aggregate context on two levels, namely, boundary level and proposal level, for generating high-quality action proposals, thereby improving the performance of temporal action detection. Specifically, we design the Multi-Path Temporal Context Aggregation (MTCA) to achieve smooth context aggregation on boundary level and precise evaluation of boundaries. For matching evaluation, Coarse-to-fine Matching (CFM) is designed to aggregate context on the proposal level and refine the matching map from coarse to fine. We conduct extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS-14. DCAN obtains an average mAP of 35.39% on ActivityNet v1.3 and reaches mAP 54.14% at IoU@0.5 on THUMOS-14, which demonstrates DCAN can generate high-quality proposals and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01683,Fairness & Bias,TransZero: Attribute-Guided Transformer for Zero-Shot Learning.,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize novel classes by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Semantic knowledge is learned from attribute descriptions shared between different classes, which act as strong priors for localizing object attributes that represent discriminative region features, enabling significant visual-semantic interaction. Although some attention-based models have attempted to learn such region features in a single image, the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of visual features are typically neglected. In this paper, we propose an attribute-guided Transformer network, termed TransZero, to refine visual features and learn attribute localization for discriminative visual embedding representations in ZSL. Specifically, TransZero takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate the cross-dataset bias between ImageNet and ZSL benchmarks, and improves the transferability of visual features by reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. To learn locality-augmented visual features, TransZero employs a visual-semantic decoder to localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute in a given image, under the guidance of semantic attribute information. Then, the locality-augmented visual features and semantic vectors are used to conduct effective visual-semantic interaction in a visual-semantic embedding network. Extensive experiments show that TransZero achieves the new state of the art on three ZSL benchmarks.

The convolution neural network (CNN) based techniques often result in highlighting the most discriminative part of objects while ignoring the entire object extent. Recently, the transformer architecture has been deployed to WSOL to capture the long-range feature dependencies with self-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron structure. Nevertheless, transformers lack the locality inductive bias inherent to CNNs and therefore may deteriorate local feature details in WSOL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework built upon the transformer, termed LCTR (Local Continuity TRansformer), which targets at enhancing the local perception capability of global features among long-range feature dependencies. To this end, we propose a relational patch-attention module (RPAM), which considers cross-patch information on a global basis. We further design a cue digging module (CDM), which utilizes local features to guide the learning trend of the model for highlighting the weak local responses.

The most important step in the evaluation of object detection algorithm is calculating the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth one. Although this procedure is well-defined and solved for planar images, it is not easy for spherical image object detection. Existing methods either compute the IoUs based on biased bounding box representations or make excessive approximations, thus would give incorrect results. In this paper, we first identify that spherical rectangles are unbiased bounding boxes for objects in spherical images, and then propose an analytical method for IoU calculation without any approximations. Based on the unbiased representation and calculation, we also present an anchor free object detection algorithm for spherical images.

An explanatory model then visualizes the encoded information from any hidden layer and its corresponding intervened representation. By the assessment of differences between the original representation and the intervened representation, one can determine the concepts that can alter the class, hence providing interpretability.

By representing the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the input data to a sequence of point proxies and employ the Transformers for generation. To facilitate Transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of Transformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud completion. Taking a step towards more complicated and diverse situations, we further propose AdaPoinTr by developing an adaptive query generation mechanism and designing a novel denoising task during completing a point cloud. Coupling these two techniques enables us to train the model efficiently and effectively: we reduce training time (by 15x or more) and improve completion performance (over 20%). We also show our method can be extended to the scene-level point cloud completion scenario by designing a new geometry-enhanced semantic scene completion framework. Extensive experiments on the existing and newly-proposed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which attains 6.53 CD on PCN, 0.81 CD on ShapeNet-55 and 0.392 MMD on real-world KITTI, surpassing other work by a large margin and establishing new state-of-the-arts on various benchmarks.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00672,Fairness & Bias,Generalizable Person Re-identification via Self-Supervised Batch Norm Test-Time Adaption.,"In this paper, we investigate the generalization problem of person re-identification (re-id), whose major challenge is the distribution shift on an unseen domain. As an important tool of regularizing the distribution, batch normalization (BN) has been widely used in existing methods. However, they neglect that BN is severely biased to the training domain and inevitably suffers the performance drop if directly generalized without being updated. To tackle this issue, we propose Batch Norm Test-time Adaption (BNTA), a novel re-id framework that applies the self-supervised strategy to update BN parameters adaptively. Specifically, BNTA quickly explores the domain-aware information within unlabeled target data before inference, and accordingly modulates the feature distribution normalized by BN to adapt to the target domain. This is accomplished by two designed self-supervised auxiliary tasks, namely part positioning and part nearest neighbor matching, which help the model mine the domain-aware information with respect to the structure and identity of body parts, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three re-id datasets and confirm the superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.",[],[],"['Ke Han', 'Chenyang Si', 'Yan Huang', 'Liang Wang', 'Tieniu Tan']",[],[]

For example, the grounding process is usually a trivial language-location association without visual reasoning, e.g., grounding any language query containing sheep to the nearly central regions, due to that most queries about sheep have ground-truth locations at the image center. First, we frame the visual grounding pipeline into a causal graph, which shows the causalities among image, query, target location and underlying confounder. Through the causal graph, we know how to break the grounding bottleneck: deconfounded visual grounding. Second, to tackle the challenge that the confounder is unobserved in general, we propose a confounder-agnostic approach called: Referring Expression Deconfounder (RED), to remove the confounding bias. Third, we implement RED as a simple language attention, which can be applied in any grounding method. On popular benchmarks, RED improves various state-of-the-art grounding methods by a significant margin.

However, when targeting the pixel-wise tasks like image fusion, it would not fully perceive the particularity of each pixel in the image if the uniform convolution kernel is used on different patches. In this paper, we propose a local adaptive convolution (LAConv), which is dynamically adjusted to different spatial locations. LAConv enables the network to pay attention to every specific local area in the learning process. Besides, the dynamic bias (DYB) is introduced to provide more possibilities for the depiction of features and make the network more flexible. We further design a residual structure network equipped with the proposed LAConv and DYB modules, and apply it to two image fusion tasks. Experiments for pansharpening and hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR) demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods.

We hypothesize that an improved disentanglement of domain-related and task-related factors of dense intermediate layer features can greatly aid OCDA. Prior-arts attempt this indirectly by employing adversarial domain discriminators on the spatial CNN output. However, we find that latent features derived from the Fourier-based amplitude spectrum of deep CNN features hold a more tractable mapping with domain discrimination. Motivated by this, we propose a novel feature space Amplitude Spectrum Transformation (AST). During adaptation, we employ the AST auto-encoder for two purposes. First, carefully mined source-target instance pairs undergo a simulation of cross-domain feature stylization (AST-Sim) at a particular layer by altering the AST-latent. Second, AST operating at a later layer is tasked to normalize (AST-Norm) the domain content by fixing its latent to a mean prototype. Our simplified adaptation technique is not only clustering-free but also free from complex adversarial alignment.

We achieve this with a simple modification of the Variational Auto-Encoder which yields a joint model of the point cloud itself along with a schematic representation of it as a combination of shape primitives. In particular, we introduce a latent representation of the point cloud which can be decomposed into a disentangled representation for each part of the shape. These parts are in turn disentangled into both a shape primitive and a point cloud representation, along with a standardising transformation to a canonical coordinate system. The dependencies between our standardising transformations preserve the spatial dependencies between the parts in a manner that allows meaningful parts-aware point cloud generation and shape editing. In addition to the flexibility afforded by our disentangled representation, the inductive bias introduced by our joint modeling approach yields state-of-the-art experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset.",[],[],"['Shidi Li', 'Miaomiao Liu', 'Christian Walder']",[],[]

To extract the point-wise features from the irregularly and sparsely distributed points, previous methods usually take a feature grouping module to aggregate the point features to an object candidate. However, these methods have not yet leveraged the surface geometry of foreground objects to enhance grouping and 3D box generation. In this paper, we propose the RBGNet framework, a voting-based 3D detector for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. In order to learn better representations of object shape to enhance cluster features for predicting 3D boxes, we propose a ray-based feature grouping module, which aggregates the point-wise features on object surfaces using a group of determined rays uniformly emitted from cluster centers. Considering the fact that foreground points are more meaningful for box estimation, we design a novel foreground biased sampling strategy in downsample process to sample more points on object surfaces and further boost the detection performance.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04138,Fairness & Bias,Contrastive Instruction-Trajectory Learning for Vision-Language Navigation.,"The vision-language navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to reach a target with the guidance of natural language instruction. Previous works learn to navigate step-by-step following an instruction. However, these works may fail to discriminate the similarities and discrepancies across instruction-trajectory pairs and ignore the temporal continuity of sub-instructions. These problems hinder agents from learning distinctive vision-and-language representations, harming the robustness and generalizability of the navigation policy. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Instruction-Trajectory Learning (CITL) framework that explores invariance across similar data samples and variance across different ones to learn distinctive representations for robust navigation. Specifically, we propose: (1) a coarse-grained contrastive learning objective to enhance vision-and-language representations by contrasting semantics of full trajectory observations and instructions, respectively; (2) a fine-grained contrastive learning objective to perceive instructions by leveraging the temporal information of the sub-instructions; (3) a pairwise sample-reweighting mechanism for contrastive learning to mine hard samples and hence mitigate the influence of data sampling bias in contrastive learning. Our CITL can be easily integrated with VLN backbones to form a new learning paradigm and achieve better generalizability in unseen environments.

Prevailing MIL methods primarily focus on improving the feature extractor and aggregator. However, one deficiency of these methods is that the bag contextual prior may trick the model into capturing spurious correlations between bags and labels. This deficiency is a confounder that limits the performance of existing MIL methods. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL), to achieve deconfounded bag-level prediction. Unlike traditional likelihood-based strategies, the proposed scheme is based on the backdoor adjustment to achieve the interventional training, thus is capable of suppressing the bias caused by the bag contextual prior.

Therefore, IBMIL is able to bring consistent performance boosting to existing schemes, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09533,Fairness & Bias,A Causal Debiasing Framework for Unsupervised Salient Object Detection.,"Unsupervised salient object detection aims to detect salient objects without using supervision signals eliminating the tedious task of manually labeling salient objects. To improve training efficiency, end-to-end methods for USOD have been proposed as a promising alternative. However, current solutions rely heavily on noisy handcraft labels and fail to mine rich semantic information from deep features. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised end-to-end salient object detection framework via top-down context. Specifically, motivated by contrastive learning, we exploit the self-localization from the deepest feature to construct the location maps which are then leveraged to learn the most instructive segmentation guidance. Further considering the lack of detailed information in deepest features, we exploit the detail-boosting refiner module to enrich the location labels with details. Moreover, we observe that due to lack of supervision, current unsupervised saliency models tend to detect non-salient objects that are salient in some other samples of corresponding scenarios. To address this widespread issue, we design a novel Unsupervised Non-Salient Suppression (UNSS) method developing the ability to ignore non-salient objects.

However, textual relations are restricted to the finite size of dataset due to lexical dependencies, which causes the problem of over-fitting and compromises representation robustness. To this end, we propose to enrich the textual relations via rearrangement, hierarchy and interaction, and design a unified framework called RCLSTR: Relational Contrastive Learning for Scene Text Recognition. Based on causality, we theoretically explain that three modules suppress the bias caused by the contextual prior and thus guarantee representation robustness.

Without access to the unseen domain, the feature statistics of the batch normalization (BN) layer learned from a limited number of source domains is doubtlessly biased for unseen domain. This would mislead the feature representation learning for unseen domain and deteriorate the generalizaiton ability of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel Debiased Batch Normalization via Gaussian Process approach (GDNorm) for generalizable person re-identification, which models the feature statistic estimation from BN layers as a dynamically self-refining Gaussian process to alleviate the bias to unseen domain for improving the generalization. Specifically, we establish a lightweight model with multiple set of domain-specific BN layers to capture the discriminability of individual source domain, and learn the corresponding parameters of the domain-specific BN layers. These parameters of different source domains are employed to deduce a Gaussian process. We randomly sample several paths from this Gaussian process served as the BN estimations of potential new domains outside of existing source domains, which can further optimize these learned parameters from source domains, and estimate more accurate Gaussian process by them in return, tending to real data distribution. Even without a large number of source domains, GDNorm can still provide debiased BN estimation by using the mean path of the Gaussian process, while maintaining low computational cost during testing.

However, the extracted knowledge is insufficient to cope with the variable intra-class differences since the knowledge is obtained from a few samples in the support set. To address the problem, we propose a multi-information aggregation network (MIANet) that effectively leverages the general knowledge, i.e., semantic word embeddings, and instance information for accurate segmentation. Specifically, in MIANet, a general information module (GIM) is proposed to extract a general class prototype from word embeddings as a supplement to instance information. To this end, we design a triplet loss that treats the general class prototype as an anchor and samples positive-negative pairs from local features in the support set. The calculated triplet loss can transfer semantic similarities among language identities from a word embedding space to a visual representation space. To alleviate the model biasing towards the seen training classes and to obtain multi-scale information, we then introduce a non-parametric hierarchical prior module (HPM) to generate unbiased instance-level information via calculating the pixel-level similarity between the support and query image features. Finally, an information fusion module (IFM) combines the general and instance information to make predictions for the query image.

In this work, we propose a novel Prototype Mining And Learning (PMAL) framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism before the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set. Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from training samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even in a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to discriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns.

Since diffusion models have recently emerged as the de facto standard generative framework with surprising generation results, novelty detection via diffusion models has also gained much attention. Recent methods have mainly utilized the reconstruction property of in-distribution samples. However, they often suffer from detecting OOD samples that share similar background information to the in-distribution data. Based on our observation that diffusion models can \emph{project} any sample to an in-distribution sample with similar background information, we propose \emph{Projection Regret (PR)}, an efficient novelty detection method that mitigates the bias of non-semantic information. To be specific, PR computes the perceptual distance between the test image and its diffusion-based projection to detect abnormality. Since the perceptual distance often fails to capture semantic changes when the background information is dominant, we cancel out the background bias by comparing it against recursive projections.

To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to generate supervision for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We argue that visually similar regions between labeled and unlabeled images likely contain the same semantics and therefore should share their label. Following this thought, we use a small number of labeled images as reference material and match pixels in an unlabeled image to the semantics of the best fitting pixel in a reference set. This way, we avoid pitfalls such as confirmation bias, common in purely prediction-based pseudo-labeling. Since our method does not require any architectural changes or accompanying networks, one can easily insert it into existing frameworks. We achieve the same performance as a standard fully supervised model on X-ray anatomy segmentation, albeit 95% fewer labeled images.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02743,Fairness & Bias,Separated Contrastive Learning for Organ-at-Risk and Gross-Tumor-Volume Segmentation with Limited Annotation.,"Automatic delineation of organ-at-risk (OAR) and gross-tumor-volume (GTV) is of great significance for radiotherapy planning. However, it is a challenging task to learn powerful representations for accurate delineation under limited pixel (voxel)-wise annotations. Contrastive learning at pixel-level can alleviate the dependency on annotations by learning dense representations from unlabeled data. Recent studies in this direction design various contrastive losses on the feature maps, to yield discriminative features for each pixel in the map. However, pixels in the same map inevitably share semantics to be closer than they actually are, which may affect the discrimination of pixels in the same map and lead to the unfair comparison to pixels in other maps. To address these issues, we propose a separated region-level contrastive learning scheme, namely SepaReg, the core of which is to separate each image into regions and encode each region separately. Specifically, SepaReg comprises two components: a structure-aware image separation (SIS) module and an intra- and inter-organ distillation (IID) module. The SIS is proposed to operate on the image set to rebuild a region set under the guidance of structural information. The inter-organ representation will be learned from this set via typical contrastive losses cross regions. On the other hand, the IID is proposed to tackle the quantity imbalance in the region set as tiny organs may produce fewer regions, by exploiting intra-organ representations. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model on a public dataset and two private datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, consistently achieving better performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03372,Fairness & Bias,Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning for Backward-Compatible Representation.,"In object re-identification (ReID), the development of deep learning techniques often involves model updates and deployment. It is unbearable to re-embedding and re-index with the system suspended when deploying new models. Therefore, backward-compatible representation is proposed to enable ""new"" features to be compared with ""old"" features directly, which means that the database is active when there are both ""new"" and ""old"" features in it. Thus we can scroll-refresh the database or even do nothing on the database to update. The existing backward-compatible methods either require a strong overlap between old and new training data or simply conduct constraints at the instance level. Thus they are difficult in handling complicated cluster structures and are limited in eliminating the impact of outliers in old embeddings, resulting in a risk of damaging the discriminative capability of new features. In this work, we propose a Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning (NCCL) method. With no assumptions about the new training data, we estimate the sub-cluster structures of old embeddings. A new embedding is constrained with multiple old embeddings in both embedding space and discrimination space at the sub-class level. The effect of outliers diminished, as the multiple samples serve as ""mean teachers"". Besides, we also propose a scheme to filter the old embeddings with low credibility, further improving the compatibility robustness. Our method ensures backward compatibility without impairing the accuracy of the new model. And it can even improve the new model's accuracy in most scenarios.",[],[],"['Shengsen Wu', 'Liang Chen', 'Yihang Lou', 'Yan Bai', 'Tao Bai', 'Minghua Deng', 'Lingyu Duan']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11948,Fairness & Bias,Domain Disentangled Generative Adversarial Network for Zero-Shot Sketch-Based 3D Shape Retrieval.,"Sketch-based 3D shape retrieval is a challenging task due to the large domain discrepancy between sketches and 3D shapes. Since existing methods are trained and evaluated on the same categories, they cannot effectively recognize the categories that have not been used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel domain disentangled generative adversarial network (DD-GAN) for zero-shot sketch-based 3D retrieval, which can retrieve the unseen categories that are not accessed during training. Specifically, we first generate domain-invariant features and domain-specific features by disentangling the learned features of sketches and 3D shapes, where the domain-invariant features are used to align with the corresponding word embeddings. Then, we develop a generative adversarial network that combines the domain-specific features of the seen categories with the aligned domain-invariant features to synthesize samples, where the synthesized samples of the unseen categories are generated by using the corresponding word embeddings. Finally, we use the synthesized samples of the unseen categories combined with the real samples of the seen categories to train the network for retrieval, so that the unseen categories can be recognized. In order to reduce the domain shift problem, we utilized unlabeled unseen samples to enhance the discrimination ability of the discriminator. With the discriminator distinguishing the generated samples from the unlabeled unseen samples, the generator can generate more realistic unseen samples. Extensive experiments on the SHREC'13 and SHREC'14 datasets show that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance of the unseen categories.",[],[],"['Rui Xu', 'Zongyan Han', 'Le Hui', 'Jianjun Qian', 'Jin Xie']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01169,Fairness & Bias,Hierarchical Image Generation via Transformer-Based Sequential Patch Selection.,"Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03803,Fairness & Bias,Suppressing Static Visual Cues via Normalizing Flows for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning.,"Despite the great progress in video understanding made by deep convolutional neural networks, feature representation learned by existing methods may be biased to static visual cues. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to suppress static visual cues (SSVC) based on probabilistic analysis for self-supervised video representation learning. In our method, video frames are first encoded to obtain latent variables under standard normal distribution via normalizing flows. By modelling static factors in a video as a random variable, the conditional distribution of each latent variable becomes shifted and scaled normal. Then, the less-varying latent variables along time are selected as static cues and suppressed to generate motion-preserved videos. Finally, positive pairs are constructed by motion-preserved videos for contrastive learning to alleviate the problem of representation bias to static cues. The less-biased video representation can be better generalized to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art when only single RGB modality is used for pre-training.",[],[],"['Manlin Zhang', 'Jinpeng Wang', 'Andy J.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14380,Fairness & Bias,Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization for Unbiased Long-Tailed Classification.,"We address the overlooked unbiasedness in existing long-tailed classification methods: we find that their overall improvement is mostly attributed to the biased preference of tail over head, as the test distribution is assumed to be balanced; however, when the test is as imbalanced as the long-tailed training data -- let the test respect Zipf's law of nature -- the tail bias is no longer beneficial overall because it hurts the head majorities. In this paper, we propose Cross-Domain Empirical Risk Minimization (xERM) for training an unbiased model to achieve strong performances on both test distributions, which empirically demonstrates that xERM fundamentally improves the classification by learning better feature representation rather than the head vs. tail game. Based on causality, we further theoretically explain why xERM achieves unbiasedness: the bias caused by the domain selection is removed by adjusting the empirical risks on the imbalanced domain and the balanced but unseen domain.

While existing work shows promising results in image classification, probability calibration has not been much explored for personalized ranking. In this paper, we aim to estimate the calibrated probability of how likely a user will prefer an item. We investigate various parametric distributions and propose two parametric calibration methods, namely Gaussian calibration and Gamma calibration. Each proposed method can be seen as a post-processing function that maps the ranking scores of pre-trained models to well-calibrated preference probabilities, without affecting the recommendation performance. We also design the unbiased empirical risk minimization framework that guides the calibration methods to learning of true preference probability from the biased user-item interaction dataset. Extensive evaluations with various personalized ranking models on real-world datasets show that both the proposed calibration methods and the unbiased empirical risk minimization significantly improve the calibration performance.",[],[],"['Wonbin Kweon', 'SeongKu Kang', 'Hwanjo Yu']",[],[]

Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14531,Fairness & Bias,Fair and Truthful Giveaway Lotteries.,"In many developing countries, the total electricity demand is larger than the limited generation capacity of power stations. Many countries adopt the common practice of routine load shedding - disconnecting entire regions from the power supply - to maintain a balance between demand and supply. Load shedding results in inflicting hardship and discomfort on households, which is even worse and hence unfair to those whose need for electricity is higher than that of others during load shedding hours. Recently, Oluwasuji et al. [2020] presented this problem and suggested several heuristic solutions. In this work, we study the electricity distribution problem as a problem of fair division, model it using the related literature on cake-cutting problems, and discuss some insights on which parts of the time intervals are allocated to each household. We consider four cases: identical demand, uniform utilities; identical demand, additive utilities; different demand, uniform utilities; different demand, additive utilities. We provide the solution for the first two cases and discuss the novel concept of q-times bin packing in relation to the remaining cases. We also show how the fourth case is related to the consensus k-division problem. One can study objectives and constraints using utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare metrics, as well as trying to keep the number of cuts as small as possible. A secondary objective can be to minimize the maximum utility-difference between agents.",[],[],"['Dinesh Kumar Baghel', 'Vadim E. Levit', 'Erel Segal-Halevi']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03278,Fairness & Bias,Coordinating Followers to Reach Better Equilibria: End-to-End Gradient Descent for Stackelberg Games.,"A growing body of work in game theory extends the traditional Stackelberg game to settings with one leader and multiple followers who play a Nash equilibrium. Standard approaches for computing equilibria in these games reformulate the followers' best response as constraints in the leader's optimization problem. These reformulation approaches can sometimes be effective, but often get trapped in low-quality solutions when followers' objectives are non-linear or non-quadratic. Moreover, these approaches assume a unique equilibrium or a specific equilibrium concept, e.g., optimistic or pessimistic, which is a limiting assumption in many situations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a stochastic gradient descent--based approach, where the leader's strategy is updated by differentiating through the followers' best responses. We frame the leader's optimization as a learning problem against followers' equilibrium, which allows us to decouple the followers' equilibrium constraints from the leader's problem. This approach also addresses cases with multiple equilibria and arbitrary equilibrium selection procedures by back-propagating through a sampled Nash equilibrium. To this end, this paper introduces a novel concept called equilibrium flow to formally characterize the set of equilibrium selection processes where the gradient with respect to a sampled equilibrium is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient. We evaluate our approach experimentally against existing baselines in three Stackelberg problems with multiple followers and find that in each case, our approach is able to achieve higher utility for the leader.",[],[],"['Kai Wang', 'Lily Xu', 'Andrew Perrault', 'Michael K.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11944,Fairness & Bias,On Testing for Discrimination Using Causal Models.,"We present counterfactual situation testing (CST), a causal data mining framework for detecting discrimination in classifiers. CST aims to answer in an actionable and meaningful way the intuitive question ""what would have been the model outcome had the individual, or complainant, been of a different protected status?"" It extends the legally-grounded situation testing of Thanh et al. (2011) by operationalizing the notion of fairness given the difference using counterfactual reasoning. For any complainant, we find and compare similar protected and non-protected instances in the dataset used by the classifier to construct a control and test group, where a difference between the decision outcomes of the two groups implies potential individual discrimination. Unlike situation testing, which builds both groups around the complainant, we build the test group on the complainant's counterfactual generated using causal knowledge. The counterfactual is intended to reflect how the protected attribute when changed affects the seemingly neutral attributes used by the classifier, which is taken for granted in many frameworks for discrimination. Under CST, we compare similar individuals within each group but dissimilar individuals across both groups due to the possible difference between the complainant and its counterfactual. Evaluating our framework on two classification scenarios, we show that it uncovers a greater number of cases than situation testing, even when the classifier satisfies the counterfactual fairness condition of Kusner et al.

Prime implicants of the complete reason are known as sufficient reasons for the decision and they correspond to what is known as PI explanations and abductive explanations. In this paper, we refer to the prime implicates of a complete reason as necessary reasons for the decision. We justify this terminology semantically and show that necessary reasons correspond to what is known as contrastive explanations. We also study the computation of complete reasons for multi-class decision trees and graphs with nominal and numeric features for which we derive efficient, closed-form complete reasons. We further investigate the computation of shortest necessary and sufficient reasons for a broad class of complete reasons, which include the derived closed forms and the complete reasons for Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs). We provide an algorithm which can enumerate their shortest necessary reasons in output polynomial time. Enumerating shortest sufficient reasons for this class of complete reasons is hard even for a single reason.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03183,Fairness & Bias,Modification-Fair Cluster Editing.,"The classic Cluster Editing problem (also known as Correlation Clustering) asks to transform a given graph into a disjoint union of cliques (clusters) by a small number of edge modifications. When applied to vertex-colored graphs (the colors representing subgroups), standard algorithms for the NP-hard Cluster Editing problem may yield solutions that are biased towards subgroups of data (e.g., demographic groups), measured in the number of modifications incident to the members of the subgroups. We propose a modification fairness constraint which ensures that the number of edits incident to each subgroup is proportional to its size. To start with, we study Modification-Fair Cluster Editing for graphs with two vertex colors. We show that the problem is NP-hard even if one may only insert edges within a subgroup; note that in the classic ""non-fair"" setting, this case is trivially polynomial-time solvable. However, in the more general editing form, the modification-fair variant remains fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of edge edits. We complement these and further theoretical results with an empirical analysis of our model on real-world social networks where we find that the price of modification-fairness is surprisingly low, that is, the cost of optimal modification-fair solutions differs from the cost of optimal ""non-fair"" solutions only by a small percentage.",[],[],"['Vincent Froese', 'Leon Kellerhals', 'Rolf Niedermeier']",[],[]

Such settings encompass a wide variety of applications including pricing, online marketing and precision medicine. A key challenge is that observational data are influenced by historical policies deployed in the system, yielding a biased data distribution. We approach this task as a domain adaptation problem and propose a self-training algorithm which imputes outcomes with categorical values for finite unseen actions in the observational data to simulate a randomized trial through pseudolabeling, which we refer to as Counterfactual Self-Training (CST).

Unfortunately, identifying the correct class label from a long sequence of candidate labels is time-consuming and laborious. To alleviate this problem, we design a novel labeling mechanism called stochastic label. In this setting, stochastic label includes two cases: 1) identify a correct class label from a small number of randomly given labels; 2) annotate the instance with None label when given labels do not contain correct class label. In this paper, we propose a novel suitable approach to learn from these stochastic labels. We obtain an unbiased estimator that utilizes less supervised information in stochastic labels to train a multi-class classifier.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06362,Fairness & Bias,Theoretical Guarantees of Fictitious Discount Algorithms for Episodic Reinforcement Learning and Global Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods.,"When designing algorithms for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning problems, a common approach is to introduce a fictitious discount factor and use stationary policies for approximations. Empirically, it has been shown that the fictitious discount factor helps reduce variance, and stationary policies serve to save the per-iteration computational cost. Theoretically, however, there is no existing work on convergence analysis for algorithms with this fictitious discount recipe. This paper takes the first step towards analyzing these algorithms. It focuses on two vanilla policy gradient (VPG) variants: the first being a widely used variant with discounted advantage estimations (DAE), the second with an additional fictitious discount factor in the score functions of the policy gradient estimators. Non-asymptotic convergence guarantees are established for both algorithms, and the additional discount factor is shown to reduce the bias introduced in DAE and thus improve the algorithm convergence asymptotically. A key ingredient of our analysis is to connect three settings of Markov decision processes (MDPs): the finite-time-horizon, the average reward and the discounted settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee on fictitious discount algorithms for the episodic reinforcement learning of finite-time-horizon MDPs, which also leads to the (first) global convergence of policy gradient methods for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning.",[],[],"['Xin Guo', 'Anran Hu', 'Junzi Zhang']",[],[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00849,Fairness & Bias,Delving into Sample Loss Curve to Embrace Noisy and Imbalanced Data.,"Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically collected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves, which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom layers.

Specifically, understanding GANs' capability across the full spectrum of spatial frequencies, i.e. beyond the low-frequency dominant spectrum of natural images, is critical for assessing the reliability of GAN generated data in any detail-sensitive application (e.g. denoising, filling and super-resolution in medical and satellite images). In this paper, we show that the ability of convolutional GANs to learn a distribution is significantly affected by the spatial frequency of the underlying carrier signal, that is, GANs have a bias against learning high spatial frequencies. Crucially, we show that this bias is not merely a result of the scarcity of high frequencies in natural images, rather, it is a systemic bias hindering the learning of high frequencies regardless of their prominence in a dataset. Furthermore, we explain why large-scale GANs' ability to generate fine details on natural images does not exclude them from the adverse effects of this bias. Finally, we propose a method for manipulating this bias with minimal computational overhead. This method can be used to explicitly direct computational resources towards any specific spatial frequency of interest in a dataset, extending the flexibility of GANs.",[],[],"['Mahyar Khayatkhoei', 'Ahmed Elgammal']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05816,Fairness & Bias,A Computable Definition of the Spectral Bias.,"Spectral bias is an important observation of neural network training, stating that the network will learn a low frequency representation of the target function before converging to higher frequency components. This property is interesting due to its link to good generalization in over-parameterized networks. However, in low dimensional settings, a severe spectral bias occurs that obstructs convergence to high frequency components entirely. In order to overcome this limitation, one can encode the inputs using a high frequency sinusoidal encoding. Previous works attempted to explain this phenomenon using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and Fourier analysis. However, NTK does not capture real network dynamics, and Fourier analysis only offers a global perspective on the network properties that induce this bias. In this paper, we provide a novel approach towards understanding spectral bias by directly studying ReLU MLP training dynamics. Specifically, we focus on the connection between the computations of ReLU networks (activation regions), and the speed of gradient descent convergence. We study these dynamics in relation to the spatial information of the signal to understand how they influence spectral bias. We then use this formulation to study the severity of spectral bias in low dimensional settings, and how positional encoding overcomes this.",[],[],"['John Lazzari', 'Xiuwen Liu']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10943,Fairness & Bias,Gradient Based Activations for Accurate Bias-Free Learning.,"Bias mitigation in machine learning models is imperative, yet challenging. While several approaches have been proposed, one view towards mitigating bias is through adversarial learning. A discriminator is used to identify the bias attributes such as gender, age or race in question. This discriminator is used adversarially to ensure that it cannot distinguish the bias attributes. The main drawback in such a model is that it directly introduces a trade-off with accuracy as the features that the discriminator deems to be sensitive for discrimination of bias could be correlated with classification. In this work we solve the problem. We show that a biased discriminator can actually be used to improve this bias-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, this is achieved by using a feature masking approach using the discriminator's gradients. We ensure that the features favoured for the bias discrimination are de-emphasized and the unbiased features are enhanced during classification. We show that this simple approach works well to reduce bias as well as improve accuracy significantly. We evaluate the proposed model on standard benchmarks. We improve the accuracy of the adversarial methods while maintaining or even improving the unbiasness and also outperform several other recent methods.",[],[],"['Vinod K Kurmi', 'Rishabh Sharma', 'Yash Vardhan Sharma', 'Vinay P.

Yet this would be a much needed feature for practical applications. In this paper, we propose an approach which learns a hyper-policy, whose input is time, that outputs the parameters of the policy to be queried at that time. This hyper-policy is trained to maximize the estimated future performance, efficiently reusing past data by means of importance sampling, at the cost of introducing a controlled bias. We combine the future performance estimate with the past performance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. To avoid overfitting the collected data, we derive a differentiable variance bound that we embed as a penalization term. Finally, we empirically validate our approach, in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, on realistic environments, including water resource management and trading.",[],[],"['Pierre Liotet', 'Francesco Vidaich', 'Alberto Maria Metelli', 'Marcello Restelli']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01634,Fairness & Bias,Beyond Shared Subspace: A View-Specific Fusion for Multi-View Multi-Label Learning.,"Multi-view (or -modality) representation learning aims to understand the relationships between different view representations. Existing methods disentangle multi-view representations into consistent and view-specific representations by introducing strong inductive biases, which can limit their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view representation disentangling method that aims to go beyond inductive biases, ensuring both interpretability and generalizability of the resulting representations. Our method is based on the observation that discovering multi-view consistency in advance can determine the disentangling information boundary, leading to a decoupled learning objective. We also found that the consistency can be easily extracted by maximizing the transformation invariance and clustering consistency between views. These observations drive us to propose a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we obtain multi-view consistency by training a consistent encoder to produce semantically-consistent representations across views as well as their corresponding pseudo-labels. In the second stage, we disentangle specificity from comprehensive representations by minimizing the upper bound of mutual information between consistent and comprehensive representations. Finally, we reconstruct the original data by concatenating pseudo-labels and view-specific representations. Our experiments on four multi-view datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms 12 comparison methods in terms of clustering and classification performance. The visualization results also show that the extracted consistency and specificity are compact and interpretable.

Current value estimation methods, such as DDPG and TD3, suffer from unnecessary over- or underestimation bias. In this paper, we explore the potential of double actors, which has been neglected for a long time, for better value function estimation in continuous setting. First, we uncover and demonstrate the bias alleviation property of double actors by building double actors upon single critic and double critics to handle overestimation bias in DDPG and underestimation bias in TD3 respectively. Next, we interestingly find that double actors help improve the exploration ability of the agent. Finally, to mitigate the uncertainty of value estimate from double critics, we further propose to regularize the critic networks under double actors architecture, which gives rise to Double Actors Regularized Critics (DARC) algorithm. Extensive experimental results on challenging continuous control tasks show that DARC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with higher sample efficiency.",[],[],"['Jiafei Lyu', 'Xiaoteng Ma', 'Jiangpeng Yan', 'Xiu Li']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02407,Fairness & Bias,An Experimental Design Approach for Regret Minimization in Logistic Bandits.,"In this work we consider the problem of regret minimization for logistic bandits. The main challenge of logistic bandits is reducing the dependence on a potentially large problem dependent constant $\kappa$ that can at worst scale exponentially with the norm of the unknown parameter $\theta_{\ast}$. Abeille et al. (2021) have applied self-concordance of the logistic function to remove this worst-case dependence providing regret guarantees like $O(d\log^2(\kappa)\sqrt{\dot\mu T}\log(|\mathcal{X}|))$ where $d$ is the dimensionality, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\dot\mu$ is the variance of the best-arm. This work improves upon this bound in the fixed arm setting by employing an experimental design procedure that achieves a minimax regret of $O(\sqrt{d \dot\mu T\log(|\mathcal{X}|)})$. Our regret bound in fact takes a tighter instance (i.e., gap) dependent regret bound for the first time in logistic bandits. We also propose a new warmup sampling algorithm that can dramatically reduce the lower order term in the regret in general and prove that it can replace the lower order term dependency on $\kappa$ to $\log^2(\kappa)$ for some instances. Finally, we discuss the impact of the bias of the MLE on the logistic bandit problem, providing an example where $d^2$ lower order regret (cf., it is $d$ for linear bandits) may not be improved as long as the MLE is used and how bias-corrected estimators may be used to make it closer to $d$.",[],[],"['Blake Mason', 'Kwang-Sung Jun', 'Lalit Jain']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00064,Fairness & Bias,An Evaluative Measure of Clustering Methods Incorporating Hyperparameter Sensitivity.,"Evaluating clustering quality with reliable evaluation metrics like normalized mutual information (NMI) requires labeled data that can be expensive to annotate. We focus on the underexplored problem of estimating clustering quality with limited labels. We adapt existing approaches from the few-sample model evaluation literature to actively sub-sample, with a learned surrogate model, the most informative data points for annotation to estimate the evaluation metric. However, we find that their estimation can be biased and only relies on the labeled data. To that end, we introduce CEREAL, a comprehensive framework for few-sample clustering evaluation that extends active sampling approaches in three key ways. First, we propose novel NMI-based acquisition functions that account for the distinctive properties of clustering and uncertainties from a learned surrogate model. Next, we use ideas from semi-supervised learning and train the surrogate model with both the labeled and unlabeled data. Finally, we pseudo-label the unlabeled data with the surrogate model. We run experiments to estimate NMI in an active sampling pipeline on three datasets across vision and language. Our results show that CEREAL reduces the area under the absolute error curve by up to 57% compared to the best sampling baseline. We perform an extensive ablation study to show that our framework is agnostic to the choice of clustering algorithm and evaluation metric. We also extend CEREAL from clusterwise annotations to pairwise annotations. Overall, CEREAL can efficiently evaluate clustering with limited human annotations.",[],[],"['Nihal V. Nayak', 'Ethan R.

We will subsequently see the importance of choosing suitable parameterizations to end up with well-defined learning processes. Especially since in the context of real-world applications, we face numerous biases due, e.g., to the specificities of sensors, the heterogeneity of data sources, the multiplicity of points of view, etc. This will lead us to the idea of exploiting the structuring of the concepts to be learned in order to organize the learning process that we published previously.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08796,Fairness & Bias,Saliency Grafting: Innocuous Attribution-Guided Mixup with Calibrated Label Mixing.,"The Mixup scheme suggests mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample and has gained considerable attention recently for improving the generalizability of neural networks. A straightforward and widely used extension of Mixup is to combine with regional dropout-like methods: removing random patches from a sample and replacing it with the features from another sample. Albeit their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods are prone to create harmful samples due to their randomness. To address this issue, 'maximum saliency' strategies were recently proposed: they select only the most informative features to prevent such a phenomenon. However, they now suffer from lack of sample diversification as they always deterministically select regions with maximum saliency, injecting bias into the augmented data. In this paper, we present, a novel, yet simple Mixup-variant that captures the best of both worlds. Our idea is two-fold. By stochastically sampling the features and 'grafting' them onto another sample, our method effectively generates diverse yet meaningful samples. Its second ingredient is to produce the label of the grafted sample by mixing the labels in a saliency-calibrated fashion, which rectifies supervision misguidance introduced by the random sampling procedure. Our experiments under CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets show that our scheme outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation strategies not only in terms of classification accuracy, but is also superior in coping under stress conditions such as data corruption and object occlusion.",[],[],"['Joonhyung Park', 'June Yong Yang', 'Jinwoo Shin', 'Sung Ju Hwang', 'Eunho Yang']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09744,Fairness & Bias,Covered Information Disentanglement: Model Transparency via Unbiased Permutation Importance.,"Model transparency is a prerequisite in many domains and an increasingly popular area in machine learning research. In the medical domain, for instance, unveiling the mechanisms behind a disease often has higher priority than the diagnostic itself since it might dictate or guide potential treatments and research directions. One of the most popular approaches to explain model global predictions is the permutation importance where the performance on permuted data is benchmarked against the baseline. However, this method and other related approaches will undervalue the importance of a feature in the presence of covariates since these cover part of its provided information. To address this issue, we propose Covered Information Disentanglement (CID), a method that considers all feature information overlap to correct the values provided by permutation importance. We further show how to compute CID efficiently when coupled with Markov random fields. We demonstrate its efficacy in adjusting permutation importance first on a controlled toy dataset and discuss its effect on real-world medical data.",[],[],"['João Pereira', 'Erik S.G.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11349,Fairness & Bias,Noise-Robust Learning from Multiple Unsupervised Sources of Inferred Labels.,"The emergence of social media as one of the main platforms for people to access news has enabled the wide dissemination of fake news. This has motivated numerous studies on automating fake news detection. Although there have been limited attempts at unsupervised fake news detection, their performance suffers due to not exploiting the knowledge from various modalities related to news records and due to the presence of various latent biases in the existing news datasets. To address these limitations, this work proposes an effective framework for unsupervised fake news detection, which first embeds the knowledge available in four modalities in news records and then proposes a novel noise-robust self-supervised learning technique to identify the veracity of news records from the multi-modal embeddings. Also, we propose a novel technique to construct news datasets minimizing the latent biases in existing news datasets. Following the proposed approach for dataset construction, we produce a Large-scale Unlabelled News Dataset consisting 419,351 news articles related to COVID-19, acronymed as LUND-COVID. We trained the proposed unsupervised framework using LUND-COVID to exploit the potential of large datasets, and evaluate it using a set of existing labelled datasets. Our results show that the proposed unsupervised framework largely outperforms existing unsupervised baselines for different tasks such as multi-modal fake news detection, fake news early detection and few-shot fake news detection, while yielding notable improvements for unseen domains during training.",[],[],"['Amila Silva', 'Ling Luo', 'Shanika Karunasekera', 'Christopher Leckie']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08800,Fairness & Bias,EqGNN: Equalized Node Opportunity in Graphs.,"Graph neural networks (GNNs), has been widely used for supervised learning tasks in graphs reaching state-of-the-art results. However, little work was dedicated to creating unbiased GNNs, i.e., where the classification is uncorrelated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. Some ignore the sensitive attributes or optimize for the criteria of statistical parity for fairness. However, it has been shown that neither approaches ensure fairness, but rather cripple the utility of the prediction task. In this work, we present a GNN framework that allows optimizing representations for the notion of Equalized Odds fairness criteria. The architecture is composed of three components: (1) a GNN classifier predicting the utility class, (2) a sampler learning the distribution of the sensitive attributes of the nodes given their labels. It generates samples fed into a (3) discriminator that discriminates between true and sampled sensitive attributes using a novel ""permutation loss"" function. Using these components, we train a model to neglect information regarding the sensitive attribute only with respect to its label. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to optimize GNNs for the equalized odds criteria. We evaluate our classifier over several graph datasets and sensitive attributes and show our algorithm reaches state-of-the-art results.",[],[],"['Uriel Singer', 'Kira Radinsky']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03749,Fairness & Bias,Powering Finetuning in Few-Shot Learning: Domain-Agnostic Bias Reduction with Selected Sampling.,"In recent works, utilizing a deep network trained on meta-training set serves as a strong baseline in few-shot learning. In this paper, we move forward to refine novel-class features by finetuning a trained deep network. Finetuning is designed to focus on reducing biases in novel-class feature distributions, which we define as two aspects: class-agnostic and class-specific biases. Class-agnostic bias is defined as the distribution shifting introduced by domain difference, which we propose Distribution Calibration Module(DCM) to reduce. DCM owes good property of eliminating domain difference and fast feature adaptation during optimization. Class-specific bias is defined as the biased estimation using a few samples in novel classes, which we propose Selected Sampling(SS) to reduce. Without inferring the actual class distribution, SS is designed by running sampling using proposal distributions around support-set samples. By powering finetuning with DCM and SS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on Meta-Dataset with consistent performance boosts over ten datasets from different domains. We believe our simple yet effective method demonstrates its possibility to be applied on practical few-shot applications.",[],[],"['Ran Tao', 'Han Zhang', 'Yutong Zheng', 'Marios Savvides']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02375,Fairness & Bias,Controlling Underestimation Bias in Reinforcement Learning via Quasi-median Operation.,"The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm works brilliantly on solving various complex control tasks. This phenomenal success can be partly attributed to DRL encouraging intelligent agents to sufficiently explore the environment and collect diverse experiences during the agent training process. Therefore, exploration plays a significant role in accessing an optimal policy for DRL. Despite recent works making great progress in continuous control tasks, exploration in these tasks has remained insufficiently investigated. To explicitly encourage exploration in continuous control tasks, we propose CCEP (Centralized Cooperative Exploration Policy), which utilizes underestimation and overestimation of value functions to maintain the capacity of exploration. CCEP first keeps two value functions initialized with different parameters, and generates diverse policies with multiple exploration styles from a pair of value functions. In addition, a centralized policy framework ensures that CCEP achieves message delivery between multiple policies, furthermore contributing to exploring the environment cooperatively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CCEP achieves higher exploration capacity. Empirical analysis shows diverse exploration styles in the learned policies by CCEP, reaping benefits in more exploration regions. And this exploration capacity of CCEP ensures it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods across multiple continuous control tasks shown in experiments.",[],[],"['Chao Li', 'Chen Gong', 'Qiang He', 'Xinwen Hou', 'Yu Liu']",[],[]

However, there is still enormous potential to be tapped to reach the fully supervised performance. In this paper, we present a novel active learning strategy to assist knowledge transfer in the target domain, dubbed active domain adaptation. We start from an observation that energy-based models exhibit \textit{free energy biases} when training (source) and test (target) data come from different distributions. Inspired by this inherent mechanism, we empirically reveal that a simple yet efficient energy-based sampling strategy sheds light on selecting the most valuable target samples than existing approaches requiring particular architectures or computation of the distances. Our algorithm, Energy-based Active Domain Adaptation (EADA), queries groups of target data that incorporate both domain characteristic and instance uncertainty into every selection round. Meanwhile, by aligning the free energy of target data compact around the source domain via a regularization term, domain gap can be implicitly diminished. Through extensive experiments, we show that EADA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on well-known challenging benchmarks with substantial improvements, making it a useful option in the open world.

We then extend our analysis to the accuracy of parameter averaging for distributed sketches. Furthermore, we develop unbiased parameter averaging methods for randomized second order optimization for regularized problems that employ sketching of the Hessian. Existing works do not take the bias of the estimators into consideration, which limits their application to massively parallel computation. We provide closed-form formulas for regularization parameters and step sizes that provably minimize the bias for sketched Newton directions.

Backpropagation is not directly applicable, nor are the reparameterization tricks used in networks with continuous stochastic variables. To address this challenge, we present Hindsight Network Credit Assignment (HNCA), a novel gradient estimation algorithm for networks of discrete stochastic units. HNCA works by assigning credit to each unit based on the degree to which its output influences its immediate children in the network. We prove that HNCA produces unbiased gradient estimates with reduced variance compared to the REINFORCE estimator, while the computational cost is similar to that of backpropagation. We first apply HNCA in a contextual bandit setting to optimize a reward function that is unknown to the agent. In this setting, we empirically demonstrate that HNCA significantly outperforms REINFORCE, indicating that the variance reduction implied by our theoretical analysis is significant and impactful. We then show how HNCA can be extended to optimize a more general function of the outputs of a network of stochastic units, where the function is known to the agent. We apply this extended version of HNCA to train a discrete variational auto-encoder and empirically show it compares favourably to other strong methods. We believe that the ideas underlying HNCA can help stimulate new ways of thinking about efficient credit assignment in stochastic compute graphs.",[],[],['Kenny Young'],[],[]

Pre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then predicting novel classes via a cosine nearest neighbor classifier with mean-based prototypes. Nevertheless, due to the data scarcity, the mean-based prototypes are usually biased. In this paper, we attempt to diminish the prototype bias by regarding it as a prototype optimization problem. To this end, we propose a novel meta-learning based prototype optimization framework to rectify prototypes, \emph{i.e.}, introducing a meta-optimizer to optimize prototypes. Although the existing meta-optimizers can also be adapted to our framework, they all overlook a crucial gradient bias issue, \emph{i.e.}, the mean-based gradient estimation is also biased on sparse data. To address the issue, we regard the gradient and its flow as meta-knowledge and then propose a novel Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based meta-optimizer to polish prototypes, called MetaNODE. In this meta-optimizer, we first view the mean-based prototypes as initial prototypes, and then model the process of prototype optimization as continuous-time dynamics specified by a Neural ODE. A gradient flow inference network is carefully designed to learn to estimate the continuous gradient flow for prototype dynamics. Finally, the optimal prototypes can be obtained by solving the Neural ODE.

We then introduce Fairness through Equivariance Regularization (Fair-ER) as a soft-constraint version of Fair-E and show that it reaches higher levels of utility than Fair-E and fairer outcomes than non-equivariant policies.

Many such methods take the form of actor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access to the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being available at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are related to the effectiveness of different types of critics.",[],[],"['Xueguang Lyu', 'Andrea Baisero', 'Yuchen Xiao', 'Christopher Amato']",[],[]

Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias towards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and proposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different fairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been proposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML classifier--essentially beyond a finite dataset--given the probability distribution of input features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers, existing fairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modeling of correlations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations of the classifiers as SSAT/SMT formulas or by sampling. In this paper, we propose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that encodes the correlations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to existing verifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for verifying linear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an accurate and scalable assessment for more diverse families of fairness-enhancing algorithms, fairness attacks, and group/causal fairness metrics than the state-of-the-art fairness verifiers.

Even though there are a number of fairness intervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete training set as input. In practice, data can have missing values, and data missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit imputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function.

Unfortunately, the research on power side-channels have so far predominantly focused on analyzing implementations of ciphers such as AES, DES, RSA, and recently post-quantum cryptography primitives (e.g., lattices). Meanwhile, machine-learning, and in particular deep-learning applications are becoming ubiquitous with several scenarios where the Machine Learning Models are Intellectual Properties requiring confidentiality. Expanding side-channel analysis to Machine Learning Model extraction, however, is largely unexplored. This paper expands the DPA framework to neural-network classifiers. First, it shows DPA attacks during inference to extract the secret model parameters such as weights and biases of a neural network. Second, it proposes the $\textit{first countermeasures}$ against these attacks by augmenting $\textit{masking}$. The resulting design uses novel masked components such as masked adder trees for fully-connected layers and masked Rectifier Linear Units for activation functions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03329,Fairness & Bias,"Inconsistent Planning: When in Doubt, Toss a Coin!","One of the most widespread human behavioral biases is the present bias -- the tendency to overestimate current costs by a bias factor. Kleinberg and Oren (2014) introduced an elegant graph-theoretical model of inconsistent planning capturing the behavior of a present-biased agent accomplishing a set of actions. The essential measure of the system introduced by Kleinberg and Oren is the cost of irrationality -- the ratio of the total cost of the actions performed by the present-biased agent to the optimal cost. This measure is vital for a task designer to estimate the aftermaths of human behavior related to time-inconsistent planning, including procrastination and abandonment. As we prove in this paper, the cost of irrationality is highly susceptible to the agent's choices when faced with a few possible actions of equal estimated costs. To address this issue, we propose a modification of Kleinberg-Oren's model of inconsistent planning.

First by modifying the k-NN based entropy estimator, we propose a new estimator which enjoys small estimation bias for samples that are close to a uniform distribution. Second we design a normalizing flow based mapping that pushes samples toward a uniform distribution, and the relation between the entropy of the original samples and the transformed ones is also derived. As a result the entropy of a given set of samples is estimated by first transforming them toward a uniform distribution and then applying the proposed estimator to the transformed samples.

While generally reliable, state-of-the-art MIP solvers base many crucial decisions on hand-crafted heuristics, largely ignoring common patterns within a given instance distribution of the problem of interest. Here, we propose MIP-GNN, a general framework for enhancing such solvers with data-driven insights. By encoding the variable-constraint interactions of a given mixed-integer linear program (MILP) as a bipartite graph, we leverage state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures to predict variable biases, i.e., component-wise averages of (near) optimal solutions, indicating how likely a variable will be set to 0 or 1 in (near) optimal solutions of binary MILPs. In turn, the predicted biases stemming from a single, once-trained model are used to guide the solver, replacing heuristic components. We integrate MIP-GNN into a state-of-the-art MIP solver, applying it to tasks such as node selection and warm-starting, showing significant improvements compared to the default setting of the solver on two classes of challenging binary MILPs.",[],[],"['Elias B.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15185,Fairness & Bias,Improving Local Search Algorithms via Probabilistic Configuration Checking.,"The Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT) is important on artificial intelligence community and the impact of its solving on complex problems. Recently, great breakthroughs have been made respectively on stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms for uniform random k-SAT resulting in several state-of-the-art SLS algorithms Score2SAT, YalSAT, ProbSAT, CScoreSAT and on a hybrid algorithm for hard random SAT (HRS) resulting in one state-of-the-art hybrid algorithm SparrowToRiss. However, there is no an algorithm which can effectively solve both uniform random k-SAT and HRS. In this paper, we present a new SLS algorithm named SelectNTS for uniform random k-SAT and HRS. SelectNTS is an improved probability selecting based local search algorithm for SAT problem. The core of SelectNTS relies on new clause and variable selection heuristics. The new clause selection heuristic uses a new clause weighting scheme and a biased random walk. The new variable selection heuristic uses a probability selecting strategy with the variation of CC strategy based on a new variable weighting scheme. Extensive experimental results on the well-known random benchmarks instances from the SAT Competitions in 2017 and 2018, and on randomly generated problems, show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art random SAT algorithms, and our SelectNTS can effectively solve both uniform random k-SAT and HRS.",[],[],"['Huimin Fu', 'Yang Xu', 'Jun Liu', 'Guanfeng Wu', 'Sutcliffe Geoff']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00002,Fairness & Bias,Mitigating Reporting Bias in Semi-supervised Temporal Commonsense Inference with Probabilistic Soft Logic.,"Temporal commonsense reasoning refers to the ability to understand the typical temporal context of phrases, actions, and events, and use it to reason over problems requiring such knowledge. This trait is essential in temporal natural language processing tasks, with possible applications such as timeline summarization, temporal question answering, and temporal natural language inference. Recent research on the performance of large language models suggests that, although they are adept at generating syntactically correct sentences and solving classification tasks, they often take shortcuts in their reasoning and fall prey to simple linguistic traps. This article provides an overview of research in the domain of temporal commonsense reasoning, particularly focusing on enhancing language model performance through a variety of augmentations and their evaluation across a growing number of datasets. However, these augmented models still struggle to approach human performance on reasoning tasks over temporal common sense properties, such as the typical occurrence times, orderings, or durations of events. We further emphasize the need for careful interpretation of research to guard against overpromising evaluation results in light of the shallow reasoning present in transformers. This can be achieved by appropriately preparing datasets and suitable evaluation metrics.",[],[],"['Georg Wenzel', 'Adam Jatowt']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07445,Fairness & Bias,AutoBERT-Zero: Evolving BERT Backbone from Scratch.,"Transformer-based pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved promising performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the conventional paradigm constructs the backbone by purely stacking the manually designed global self-attention layers, introducing inductive bias and thus leads to sub-optimal. In this work, we make the first attempt to automatically discover novel pre-trained language model (PLM) backbone on a flexible search space containing the most fundamental operations from scratch. Specifically, we propose a well-designed search space which (i) contains primitive math operations in the intra-layer level to explore novel attention structures, and (ii) leverages convolution blocks to be the supplementary for attentions in the inter-layer level to better learn local dependency. To enhance the efficiency for finding promising architectures, we propose an Operation-Priority Neural Architecture Search (OP-NAS) algorithm, which optimizes both the search algorithm and evaluation of candidate models. Specifically, we propose Operation-Priority (OP) evolution strategy to facilitate model search via balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we design a Bi-branch Weight-Sharing (BIWS) training strategy for fast model evaluation. Extensive experiments show that the searched architecture (named AutoBERT-Zero) significantly outperforms BERT and its variants of different model capacities in various downstream tasks, proving the architecture's transfer and scaling abilities. Remarkably, AutoBERT-Zero-base outperforms RoBERTa-base (using much more data) and BERT-large (with much larger model size) by 2.4 and 1.4 higher score on GLUE test set.",[],[],"['Jiahui Gao', 'Hang Xu', 'Han Shi', 'Xiaozhe Ren', 'Philip L.H.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12784,Fairness & Bias,Deep Clustering of Text Representations for Supervision-Free Probing of Syntax.,"We explore deep clustering of text representations for unsupervised model interpretation and induction of syntax. As these representations are high-dimensional, out-of-the-box methods like KMeans do not work well. Thus, our approach jointly transforms the representations into a lower-dimensional cluster-friendly space and clusters them. We consider two notions of syntax: Part of speech Induction (POSI) and constituency labelling (CoLab) in this work. Interestingly, we find that Multilingual BERT (mBERT) contains surprising amount of syntactic knowledge of English; possibly even as much as English BERT (EBERT). Our model can be used as a supervision-free probe which is arguably a less-biased way of probing. We find that unsupervised probes show benefits from higher layers as compared to supervised probes. We further note that our unsupervised probe utilizes EBERT and mBERT representations differently, especially for POSI. We validate the efficacy of our probe by demonstrating its capabilities as an unsupervised syntax induction technique. Our probe works well for both syntactic formalisms by simply adapting the input representations. We report competitive performance of our probe on 45-tag English POSI, state-of-the-art performance on 12-tag POSI across 10 languages, and competitive results on CoLab.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06411,Fairness & Bias,Attention Biasing and Context Augmentation for Zero-Shot Control of Encoder-Decoder Transformers for Natural Language Generation.,"Controlling neural network-based models for natural language generation (NLG) has broad applications in numerous areas such as machine translation, document summarization, and dialog systems. Approaches that enable such control in a zero-shot manner would be of great importance as, among other reasons, they remove the need for additional annotated data and training. In this work, we propose novel approaches for controlling encoder-decoder transformer-based NLG models in zero-shot. This is done by introducing three control knobs, namely, attention biasing, decoder mixing, and context augmentation, that are applied to these models at generation time. These knobs control the generation process by directly manipulating trained NLG models (e.g., biasing cross-attention layers) to realize the desired attributes in the generated outputs. We show that not only are these NLG models robust to such manipulations, but also their behavior could be controlled without an impact on their generation performance. These results, to the best of our knowledge, are the first of their kind. Through these control knobs, we also investigate the role of transformer decoder's self-attention module and show strong evidence that its primary role is maintaining fluency of sentences generated by these models. Based on this hypothesis, we show that alternative architectures for transformer decoders could be viable options. We also study how this hypothesis could lead to more efficient ways for training encoder-decoder transformer models.",[],[],"['Devamanyu Hazarika', 'Mahdi Namazifar', 'Dilek Hakkani-Tür']",[],[]

In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of performing grounded language acquisition on paired visual percepts and raw speech inputs. This will allow interactions in which language about novel tasks and environments is learned from end users, reducing dependence on textual inputs and potentially mitigating the effects of demographic bias found in widely available speech recognition systems.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10070,Fairness & Bias,Unified Named Entity Recognition as Word-Word Relation Classification.,"So far, named entity recognition (NER) has been involved with three major types, including flat, overlapped (aka. nested), and discontinuous NER, which have mostly been studied individually. Recently, a growing interest has been built for unified NER, tackling the above three jobs concurrently with one single model. Current best-performing methods mainly include span-based and sequence-to-sequence models, where unfortunately the former merely focus on boundary identification and the latter may suffer from exposure bias. In this work, we present a novel alternative by modeling the unified NER as word-word relation classification, namely W^2NER. The architecture resolves the kernel bottleneck of unified NER by effectively modeling the neighboring relations between entity words with Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word-* (THW-*) relations. Based on the W^2NER scheme we develop a neural framework, in which the unified NER is modeled as a 2D grid of word pairs. We then propose multi-granularity 2D convolutions for better refining the grid representations. Finally, a co-predictor is used to sufficiently reason the word-word relations. We perform extensive experiments on 14 widely-used benchmark datasets for flat, overlapped, and discontinuous NER (8 English and 6 Chinese datasets), where our model beats all the current top-performing baselines, pushing the state-of-the-art performances of unified NER.",[],[],"['Jingye Li', 'Hao Fei', 'Jiang Liu', 'Shengqiong Wu', 'Meishan Zhang', 'Chong Teng', 'Donghong Ji', 'Fei Li']",[],[]

We show that this notion is problematic in the context of NLP as it considers a narrow spectrum of linguistic phenomena. In this paper, we argue for semantic robustness, which is better aligned with the human concept of linguistic fidelity. We characterize semantic robustness in terms of biases that it is expected to induce in a model. We study semantic robustness of a range of vanilla and robustly trained architectures using a template-based generative test bed. We complement the analysis with empirical evidence that, despite being harder to implement, semantic robustness can improve performance %gives guarantees for on complex linguistic phenomena where models robust in the classical sense fail.",[],[],"['Emanuele La Malfa', 'Marta Kwiatkowska']",[],[]

A recent line of work, detection-based defense, aims to distinguish adversarial sentences from benign ones. However, {the core limitation of previous detection methods is being incapable of giving correct predictions on adversarial sentences unlike defense methods from other paradigms.} To solve this issue, this paper proposes TextShield: (1) we discover a link between text attack and saliency information, and then we propose a saliency-based detector, which can effectively detect whether an input sentence is adversarial or not. (2) We design a saliency-based corrector, which converts the detected adversary sentences to benign ones. By combining the saliency-based detector and corrector, TextShield extends the detection-only paradigm to a detection-correction paradigm, thus filling the gap in the existing detection-based defense. Comprehensive experiments show that (a) TextShield consistently achieves higher or comparable performance than state-of-the-art defense methods across various attacks on different benchmarks.

Existing de-biasing approaches focus on preventing the models from learning these biases, which can result in restrictive models and lower performance. We instead investigate teaching the model how a human would approach the NLI task, in order to learn features that will generalise better to previously unseen examples. Using natural language explanations, we supervise the model's attention weights to encourage more attention to be paid to the words present in the explanations, significantly improving model performance. Our experiments show that the in-distribution improvements of this method are also accompanied by out-of-distribution improvements, with the supervised models learning from features that generalise better to other NLI datasets. Analysis of the model indicates that human explanations encourage increased attention on the important words, with more attention paid to words in the premise and less attention paid to punctuation and stop-words.",[],[],"['Joe Stacey', 'Yonatan Belinkov', 'Marek Rei']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10392,Fairness & Bias,Debiasing NLU Models via Causal Intervention and Counterfactual Reasoning.,"Stance detection models may tend to rely on dataset bias in the text part as a shortcut and thus fail to sufficiently learn the interaction between the targets and texts. Recent debiasing methods usually treated features learned by small models or big models at earlier steps as bias features and proposed to exclude the branch learning those bias features during inference. However, most of these methods fail to disentangle the ``good'' stance features and ``bad'' bias features in the text part. In this paper, we investigate how to mitigate dataset bias in stance detection. Motivated by causal effects, we leverage a novel counterfactual inference framework, which enables us to capture the dataset bias in the text part as the direct causal effect of the text on stances and reduce the dataset bias in the text part by subtracting the direct text effect from the total causal effect. We novelly model bias features as features that correlate with the stance labels but fail on intermediate stance reasoning subtasks and propose an adversarial bias learning module to model the bias more accurately. To verify whether our model could better model the interaction between texts and targets, we test our model on recently proposed test sets to evaluate the understanding of the task from various aspects. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method (1) could better model the bias features, and (2) outperforms existing debiasing baselines on both the original dataset and most of the newly constructed test sets.",[],[],"['Jianhua Yuan', 'Yanyan Zhao', 'Bing Qin']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07504,Fairness & Bias,VAST: The Valence-Assessing Semantics Test for Contextualizing Language Models.,"VAST, the Valence-Assessing Semantics Test, is a novel intrinsic evaluation task for contextualized word embeddings (CWEs). VAST uses valence, the association of a word with pleasantness, to measure the correspondence of word-level LM semantics with widely used human judgments, and examines the effects of contextualization, tokenization, and LM-specific geometry. Because prior research has found that CWEs from GPT-2 perform poorly on other intrinsic evaluations, we select GPT-2 as our primary subject, and include results showing that VAST is useful for 7 other LMs, and can be used in 7 languages. GPT-2 results show that the semantics of a word incorporate the semantics of context in layers closer to model output, such that VAST scores diverge between our contextual settings, ranging from Pearson's rho of .55 to .77 in layer 11. We also show that multiply tokenized words are not semantically encoded until layer 8, where they achieve Pearson's rho of .46, indicating the presence of an encoding process for multiply tokenized words which differs from that of singly tokenized words, for which rho is highest in layer 0. We find that a few neurons with values having greater magnitude than the rest mask word-level semantics in GPT-2's top layer, but that word-level semantics can be recovered by nullifying non-semantic principal components: Pearson's rho in the top layer improves from .32 to .76. After isolating semantics, we show the utility of VAST for understanding LM semantics via improvements over related work on four word similarity tasks, with a score of .50 on SimLex-999, better than the previous best of .45 for GPT-2. Finally, we show that 8 of 10 WEAT bias tests, which compare differences in word embedding associations between groups of words, exhibit more stereotype-congruent biases after isolating semantics, indicating that non-semantic structures in LMs also mask biases.",[],[],"['Robert Wolfe', 'Aylin Caliskan']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09335,Fairness & Bias,A Graph Convolutional Network with Adaptive Graph Generation and Channel Selection for Event Detection.,"Event detection (ED) is aimed to identify the key trigger words in unstructured text and predict the event types accordingly. Traditional ED models are too data-hungry to accommodate real applications with scarce labeled data. Besides, typical ED models are facing the context-bypassing and disabled generalization issues caused by the trigger bias stemming from ED datasets. Therefore, we focus on the true few-shot paradigm to satisfy the low-resource scenarios. In particular, we propose a multi-step prompt learning model (MsPrompt) for debiasing few-shot event detection, that consists of the following three components: an under-sampling module targeting to construct a novel training set that accommodates the true few-shot setting, a multi-step prompt module equipped with a knowledge-enhanced ontology to leverage the event semantics and latent prior knowledge in the PLMs sufficiently for tackling the context-bypassing problem, and a prototypical module compensating for the weakness of classifying events with sparse data and boost the generalization performance. Experiments on two public datasets ACE-2005 and FewEvent show that MsPrompt can outperform the state-of-the-art models, especially in the strict low-resource scenarios reporting 11.43% improvement in terms of weighted F1-score against the best-performing baseline and achieving an outstanding debiasing performance.",[],[],"['Siyuan Wang', 'Jianming Zheng', 'Xuejun Hu', 'Fei Cai', 'Chengyu Song', 'Xueshan Luo']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07176,Fairness & Bias,SAS: Self-Augmentation Strategy for Language Model Pre-training.,"The core of self-supervised learning for pre-training language models includes pre-training task design as well as appropriate data augmentation. Most data augmentations in language model pre-training are context-independent. A seminal contextualized augmentation was recently proposed in ELECTRA and achieved state-of-the-art performance by introducing an auxiliary generation network (generator) to produce contextualized data augmentation for the training of a main discrimination network (discriminator). This design, however, introduces extra computation cost of the generator and a need to adjust the relative capability between the generator and the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a self-augmentation strategy (SAS) where a single network is utilized for both regular pre-training and contextualized data augmentation for the training in later epochs. Essentially, this strategy eliminates a separate generator and uses the single network to jointly conduct two pre-training tasks with MLM (Masked Language Modeling) and RTD (Replaced Token Detection) heads. It avoids the challenge to search for an appropriate size of the generator, which is critical to the performance as evidenced in ELECTRA and its subsequent variant models. In addition, SAS is a general strategy that can be seamlessly combined with many new techniques emerging recently or in the future, such as the disentangled attention mechanism from DeBERTa. Our experiments show that SAS is able to outperform ELECTRA and other state-of-the-art models in the GLUE tasks with similar or less computation cost.",[],[],"['Yifei Xu', 'Jingqiao Zhang', 'Ru He', 'Liangzhu Ge', 'Chao Yang', 'Cheng Yang', 'Ying Nian Wu']",[],[]

Machine Learning (ML) models trained with the available data, which is limited in quantity and poor in diversity, will often be biased and inaccurate. At the same time, ML algorithms designed to fight pandemics must have good performance and be developed in a time-sensitive manner. To tackle the challenges of limited data, and label scarcity in the available data, we propose generating conditional synthetic data, to be used alongside real data for developing robust ML models. $\textbf{Methods:}$ We present a hybrid model consisting of a conditional generative flow and a classifier for conditional synthetic data generation. The classifier decouples the feature representation for the condition, which is fed to the flow to extract the local noise.

Traditional causal effect estimation methods such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recently Regression-With-Residuals (RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challenging task of identifying the SCM parameters - to estimate ACE and CACE. However, much work remains before traditional estimation methods can be used for counterfactual inference, and for the benefit of Personalized Public Policy Analysis (P$^3$A) in the social sciences. While doctors rely on personalized medicine to tailor treatments to patients in laboratory settings (relatively closed systems), P$^3$A draws inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it for open social systems. In this article, we develop a method for counterfactual inference that we name causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitating P$^3$A. First, we show how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making any assumption about functional forms. Second, we propose a novel dequantization trick to deal with discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizing flows in general. Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performs on-par with IPW and RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ATE, when the true functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown. Fourth and most importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs, demonstrating promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like other traditional methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFs will likely play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitating P$^3$A, optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current `one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods.",[],[],"['Sourabh Balgi', 'Jose M.

Previous studies have shown that word embeddings trained on human-generated corpora have strong gender biases that can produce discriminative results in downstream tasks. Previous debiasing methods focus mainly on modeling bias and only implicitly consider semantic information while completely overlooking the complex underlying causal structure among bias and semantic components. To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology that leverages a causal inference framework to effectively remove gender bias.

Adversarial Attacking and Improving Gender Fairness in Image Search.,"Machine learning (ML) technologies are known to be riddled with ethical and operational problems, however, we are witnessing an increasing thrust by businesses to deploy them in sensitive applications. One major issue among many is that ML models do not perform equally well for underrepresented groups. This puts vulnerable populations in an even disadvantaged and unfavorable position. We propose an approach that leverages the power of web search and generative models to alleviate some of the shortcomings of discriminative models. We demonstrate our method on an image classification problem using ImageNet's People Subtree subset, and show that it is effective in enhancing robustness and mitigating bias in certain classes that represent vulnerable populations (e.g., female doctor of color). Our new method is able to (1) identify weak decision boundaries for such classes; (2) construct search queries for Google as well as text for generating images through DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion; and (3) show how these newly captured training samples could alleviate population bias issue. While still improving the model's overall performance considerably, we achieve a significant reduction (77.30\%) in the model's gender accuracy disparity. In addition to these improvements, we observed a notable enhancement in the classifier's decision boundary, as it is characterized by fewer weakspots and an increased separation between classes.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07496,Fairness & Bias,Unmasking the Mask - Evaluating Social Biases in Masked Language Models.,"Masked Language Models (MLMs) have shown superior performances in numerous downstream NLP tasks when used as text encoders. Unfortunately, MLMs also demonstrate significantly worrying levels of social biases. We show that the previously proposed evaluation metrics for quantifying the social biases in MLMs are problematic due to following reasons: (1) prediction accuracy of the masked tokens itself tend to be low in some MLMs, which raises questions regarding the reliability of the evaluation metrics that use the (pseudo) likelihood of the predicted tokens, and (2) the correlation between the prediction accuracy of the mask and the performance in downstream NLP tasks is not taken into consideration, and (3) high frequency words in the training data are masked more often, introducing noise due to this selection bias in the test cases. To overcome the above-mentioned disfluencies, we propose All Unmasked Likelihood (AUL), a bias evaluation measure that predicts all tokens in a test case given the MLM embedding of the unmasked input. We find that AUL accurately detects different types of biases in MLMs. We also propose AUL with attention weights (AULA) to evaluate tokens based on their importance in a sentence. However, unlike AUL and AULA, previously proposed bias evaluation measures for MLMs systematically overestimate the measured biases, and are heavily influenced by the unmasked tokens in the context.",[],[],"['Masahiro Kaneko', 'Danushka Bollegala']",[],[]

CrossWalk is applicable to any random walk based node representation learning algorithm, such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec. The key idea is to bias random walks to cross group boundaries, by upweighting edges which (1) are closer to the groups' peripheries or (2) connect different groups in the network. CrossWalk pulls nodes that are near groups' peripheries towards their neighbors from other groups in the embedding space, while preserving the necessary structural properties of the graph.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04392,Fairness & Bias,Fair Conformal Predictors for Applications in Medical Imaging.,"Deep learning has the potential to automate many clinically useful tasks in medical imaging. However translation of deep learning into clinical practice has been hindered by issues such as lack of the transparency and interpretability in these ""black box"" algorithms compared to traditional statistical methods. Specifically, many clinical deep learning models lack rigorous and robust techniques for conveying certainty (or lack thereof) in their predictions -- ultimately limiting their appeal for extensive use in medical decision-making. Furthermore, numerous demonstrations of algorithmic bias have increased hesitancy towards deployment of deep learning for clinical applications. To this end, we explore how conformal predictions can complement existing deep learning approaches by providing an intuitive way of expressing uncertainty while facilitating greater transparency to clinical users. In this paper, we conduct field interviews with radiologists to assess possible use-cases for conformal predictors.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13369,Fairness & Bias,Gender and Racial Stereotype Detection in Legal Opinion Word Embeddings.,"Studies have shown that some Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems encode and replicate harmful biases with potential adverse ethical effects in our society. In this article, we propose an approach for identifying gender and racial stereotypes in word embeddings trained on judicial opinions from U.S. case law. Embeddings containing stereotype information may cause harm when used by downstream systems for classification, information extraction, question answering, or other machine learning systems used to build legal research tools. We first explain how previously proposed methods for identifying these biases are not well suited for use with word embeddings trained on legal opinion text. We then propose a domain adapted method for identifying gender and racial biases in the legal domain. Our analyses using these methods suggest that racial and gender biases are encoded into word embeddings trained on legal opinions. These biases are not mitigated by exclusion of historical data, and appear across multiple large topical areas of the law. Implications for downstream systems that use legal opinion word embeddings and suggestions for potential mitigation strategies based on our observations are also discussed.",[],[],"['Sean Matthews', 'John Hudzina', 'Dawn Sepehr']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11812,Fairness & Bias,Investigations of Performance and Bias in Human-AI Teamwork in Hiring.,"In AI-assisted decision-making, effective hybrid (human-AI) teamwork is not solely dependent on AI performance alone, but also on its impact on human decision-making. While prior work studies the effects of model accuracy on humans, we endeavour here to investigate the complex dynamics of how both a model's predictive performance and bias may transfer to humans in a recommendation-aided decision task. We consider the domain of ML-assisted hiring, where humans -- operating in a constrained selection setting -- can choose whether they wish to utilize a trained model's inferences to help select candidates from written biographies. We conduct a large-scale user study leveraging a re-created dataset of real bios from prior work, where humans predict the ground truth occupation of given candidates with and without the help of three different NLP classifiers (random, bag-of-words, and deep neural network). Our results demonstrate that while high-performance models significantly improve human performance in a hybrid setting, some models mitigate hybrid bias while others accentuate it. We examine these findings through the lens of decision conformity and observe that our model architecture choices have an impact on human-AI conformity and bias, motivating the explicit need to assess these complex dynamics prior to deployment.",[],[],"['Andi Peng', 'Besmira Nushi', 'Emre Kiciman', 'Kori Inkpen', 'Ece Kamar']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12333,Fairness & Bias,"Fairness by ""Where"": A Statistically-Robust and Model-Agnostic Bi-level Learning Framework.","This paper studies algorithmic fairness when the protected attribute is location. To handle protected attributes that are continuous, such as age or income, the standard approach is to discretize the domain into predefined groups, and compare algorithmic outcomes across groups. However, applying this idea to location raises concerns of gerrymandering and may introduce statistical bias. Prior work addresses these concerns but only for regularly spaced locations, while raising other issues, most notably its inability to discern regions that are likely to exhibit spatial unfairness. Similar to established notions of algorithmic fairness, we define spatial fairness as the statistical independence of outcomes from location. This translates into requiring that for each region of space, the distribution of outcomes is identical inside and outside the region. To allow for localized discrepancies in the distribution of outcomes, we compare how well two competing hypotheses explain the observed outcomes. The null hypothesis assumes spatial fairness, while the alternate allows different distributions inside and outside regions. Their goodness of fit is then assessed by a likelihood ratio test. If there is no significant difference in how well the two hypotheses explain the observed outcomes, we conclude that the algorithm is spatially fair.",[],[],"['Dimitris Sacharidis', 'Giorgos Giannopoulos', 'George Papastefanatos', 'Kostas Stefanidis']",[],[]

Here we consider fairness in longitudinal right-censored environments, where the time to event might be unknown, resulting in censorship of the class label and inapplicability of existing fairness studies. We devise applicable fairness measures, propose a debiasing algorithm, and provide necessary theoretical constructs to bridge fairness with and without censorship for these important and socially-sensitive tasks.

Recently, there have been several proposals for how to design objectives for these systems that attempt to achieve some combination of fairness, efficiency, incentive compatibility, and satisfactory aggregation of stakeholder preferences. This paper lays out possible roles and opportunities for AI in this domain, arguing for a closer engagement with the political philosophy literature on local justice, which provides a framework for thinking about how societies have over time framed objectives for such allocation problems.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07195,Fairness & Bias,Target Languages (vs. Inductive Biases) for Learning to Act and Plan.,"Recent breakthroughs in AI have shown the remarkable power of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. These developments, however, have been tied to specific tasks, and progress in out-of-distribution generalization has been limited. While it is assumed that these limitations can be overcome by incorporating suitable inductive biases, the notion of inductive biases itself is often left vague and does not provide meaningful guidance. In the paper, I articulate a different learning approach where representations do not emerge from biases in a neural architecture but are learned over a given target language with a known semantics. The basic ideas are implicit in mainstream AI where representations have been encoded in languages ranging from fragments of first-order logic to probabilistic structural causal models. The challenge is to learn from data the representations that have traditionally been crafted by hand. Generalization is then a result of the semantics of the language. The goals of this paper are to make these ideas explicit, to place them in a broader context where the design of the target language is crucial, and to illustrate them in the context of learning to act and plan. For this, after a general discussion, I consider learning representations of actions, general policies, and subgoals (""intrinsic rewards""). In these cases, learning is formulated as a combinatorial problem but nothing prevents the use of deep learning techniques instead. Indeed, learning representations over languages with a known semantics provides an account of what is to be learned, while learning representations with neural nets provides a complementary account of how representations can be learned. The challenge and the opportunity is to bring the two together.",[],[],['Hector Geffner'],[],[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00568,Fairness & Bias,Combating Sampling Bias: A Self-Training Method in Credit Risk Models.,"In financial credit scoring, loan applications may be approved or rejected. We can only observe default/non-default labels for approved samples but have no observations for rejected samples, which leads to missing-not-at-random selection bias. Machine learning models trained on such biased data are inevitably unreliable. In this work, we find that the default/non-default classification task and the rejection/approval classification task are highly correlated, according to both real-world data study and theoretical analysis. Consequently, the learning of default/non-default can benefit from rejection/approval. Accordingly, we for the first time propose to model the biased credit scoring data with Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Specifically, we propose a novel Reject-aware Multi-Task Network (RMT-Net), which learns the task weights that control the information sharing from the rejection/approval task to the default/non-default task by a gating network based on rejection probabilities. RMT-Net leverages the relation between the two tasks that the larger the rejection probability, the more the default/non-default task needs to learn from the rejection/approval task. Furthermore, we extend RMT-Net to RMT-Net++ for modeling scenarios with multiple rejection/approval strategies. Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets, and strongly verifies the effectiveness of RMT-Net on both approved and rejected samples. In addition, RMT-Net++ further improves RMT-Net's performances.",[],[],"['Qiang Liu', 'Yingtao Luo', 'Shu Wu', 'Zhen Zhang', 'Xiangnan Yue', 'Hong Jin', 'Liang Wang']",[],[]

First, we develop a general purpose multi-modal neural fusion network model MSNF for learning students' academic information representation by fusing spatial and temporal unstructured advising notes with spatiotemporal structured data. MSNF combines a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based document embedding framework to represent each advising note, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal advising note embeddings, LSTM network to model students' temporal performance variables and students' static demographics altogether.

Despite the high-quality generated faces, some minority groups can be rarely generated from the trained models due to a biased image generation process. To study the issue, we first conduct an empirical study on a pre-trained face synthesis model. We observe that after training the GAN model not only carries the biases in the training data but also amplifies them to some degree in the image generation process. To further improve the fairness of image generation, we propose an interpretable baseline method to balance the output facial attributes without retraining. The proposed method shifts the interpretable semantic distribution in the latent space for a more balanced image generation while preserving the sample diversity. Besides producing more balanced data regarding a particular attribute (e.g., race, gender, etc.), our method is generalizable to handle more than one attribute at a time and synthesize samples of fine-grained subgroups. We further show the positive applicability of the balanced data sampled from GANs to quantify the biases in other face recognition systems, like commercial face attribute classifiers and face super-resolution algorithms.",[],[],"['Shuhan Tan', 'Yujun Shen', 'Bolei Zhou']",[],[]

However, recent studies have demonstrated the existence of social bias in these pretrained NLP models. Although prior works have made progress on word-level debiasing, improved sentence-level fairness of pretrained encoders still lacks exploration. In this paper, we proposed the first neural debiasing method for a pretrained sentence encoder, which transforms the pretrained encoder outputs into debiased representations via a fair filter (FairFil) network. To learn the FairFil, we introduce a contrastive learning framework that not only minimizes the correlation between filtered embeddings and bias words but also preserves rich semantic information of the original sentences. On real-world datasets, our FairFil effectively reduces the bias degree of pretrained text encoders, while continuously showing desirable performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, our post-hoc method does not require any retraining of the text encoders, further enlarging FairFil's application space.",[],[],"['Pengyu Cheng', 'Weituo Hao', 'Siyang Yuan', 'Shijing Si', 'Lawrence Carin']",[],[]

Merits conditioned on observable features are always \emph{uncertain}, a fact that is exacerbated by the widespread use of machine learning algorithms to infer merit from the observables. As our key contribution, we carefully axiomatize a notion of individual fairness in the two-sided marketplace setting which respects the uncertainty in the merits; indeed, it simultaneously recognizes uncertainty as the primary potential cause of unfairness and an approach to address it. We design a linear programming framework to find fair utility-maximizing distributions over allocations, and we show that the linear program is robust to perturbations in the estimated parameters of the uncertain merit distributions, a key property in combining the approach with machine learning techniques.",[],[],"['Siddartha Devic', 'David Kempe', 'Vatsal Sharan', 'Aleksandra Korolova']",[],[]

These seemingly minor alterations can lead to unexpected and substantial unfair outcomes, disproportionately affecting underrepresented individuals or groups and perpetuating pre-existing inequalities. Moreover, the Butterfly Effect can amplify inherent biases within data or algorithms, exacerbate feedback loops, and create vulnerabilities for adversarial attacks. Given the intricate nature of AI systems and their societal implications, it is crucial to thoroughly examine any changes to algorithms or input data for potential unintended consequences.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09943,Fairness & Bias,The Importance of Hyperparameter Optimisation for Facial Recognition Applications.,"Face recognition systems are widely deployed in safety-critical applications, including law enforcement, yet they exhibit bias across a range of socio-demographic dimensions, such as gender and race. Conventional wisdom dictates that model biases arise from biased training data. As a consequence, previous works on bias mitigation largely focused on pre-processing the training data, adding penalties to prevent bias from effecting the model during training, or post-processing predictions to debias them, yet these approaches have shown limited success on hard problems such as face recognition. In our work, we discover that biases are actually inherent to neural network architectures themselves. Following this reframing, we conduct the first neural architecture search for fairness, jointly with a search for hyperparameters. Our search outputs a suite of models which Pareto-dominate all other high-performance architectures and existing bias mitigation methods in terms of accuracy and fairness, often by large margins, on the two most widely used datasets for face identification, CelebA and VGGFace2.

As a result, a growing community of researchers has been investigating the equity of existing algorithms and proposing novel ones, advancing the understanding of risks and opportunities of automated decision-making for historically disadvantaged populations. Progress in fair Machine Learning hinges on data, which can be appropriately used only if adequately documented. Unfortunately, the algorithmic fairness community suffers from a collective data documentation debt caused by a lack of information on specific resources (opacity) and scatteredness of available information (sparsity). In this work, we target data documentation debt by surveying over two hundred datasets employed in algorithmic fairness research, and producing standardized and searchable documentation for each of them. Moreover we rigorously identify the three most popular fairness datasets, namely Adult, COMPAS and German Credit, for which we compile in-depth documentation. This unifying documentation effort supports multiple contributions.

Usually, the given source domain pre-trained model is expected to optimize with only unlabeled target data, which is termed as source-free unsupervised domain adaptation. In this paper, we solve this problem from the perspective of noisy label learning, since the given pre-trained model can pre-generate noisy label for unlabeled target data via directly network inference. Under this problem modeling, incorporating self-supervised learning, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Noisy Label Learning method, which can effectively fine-tune the pre-trained model with pre-generated label as well as selfgenerated label on the fly.

In this paper, we propose PrivateSNN, which aims to build low-power Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) from a pre-trained ANN model without leaking sensitive information contained in a dataset. Here, we tackle two types of leakage problems: 1) Data leakage is caused when the networks access real training data during an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is caused when class-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order to address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the pre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using the generated images. However, converted SNNs remain vulnerable to class leakage since the weight parameters have the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we encrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule. Updating weight parameters with temporal data makes SNNs difficult to be interpreted in the spatial domain. We observe that the encrypted PrivateSNN eliminates data and class leakage issues with a slight performance drop (less than ~2) and significant energy-efficiency gain (about 55x) compared to the standard ANN. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, highlighting the importance of privacy-preserving SNN training.",[],[],"['Youngeun Kim', 'Yeshwanth Venkatesha', 'Priyadarshini Panda']",[],[]

As the current high accuracy is guaranteed by very deep network structures, facial images often need to be transmitted to third-party servers with high computational power for inference. However, facial images visually reveal the user's identity information. In this process, both untrusted service providers and malicious users can significantly increase the risk of a personal privacy breach. Current privacy-preserving approaches to face recognition are often accompanied by many side effects, such as a significant increase in inference time or a noticeable decrease in recognition accuracy. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving face recognition method using differential privacy in the frequency domain. Due to the utilization of differential privacy, it offers a guarantee of privacy in theory. Meanwhile, the loss of accuracy is very slight. This method first converts the original image to the frequency domain and removes the direct component termed DC. Then a privacy budget allocation method can be learned based on the loss of the back-end face recognition network within the differential privacy framework. Finally, it adds the corresponding noise to the frequency domain features. Our method performs very well with several classical face recognition test sets according to the extensive experiments.",[],[],"['Jiazhen Ji', 'Huan Wang', 'Yuge Huang', 'Jiaxiang Wu', 'Xingkun Xu', 'Shouhong Ding', 'ShengChuan Zhang', 'Liujuan Cao', 'Rongrong Ji']",[],[]

Data curators who employ differential privacy need to respect such constraints on the sanitized data product as a primary utility requirement. Invariants challenge the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of privacy guarantees. We propose subspace differential privacy, to honestly characterize the dependence of the sanitized output on confidential aspects of the data. We discuss two design frameworks that convert well-known differentially private mechanisms, such as the Gaussian and the Laplace mechanisms, to subspace differentially private ones that respect the invariants specified by the curator. For linear queries, we discuss the design of near-optimal mechanisms that minimize the mean squared error. Subspace differentially private mechanisms rid the need for post-processing due to invariants, preserve transparency and statistical intelligibility of the output, and can be suitable for distributed implementation.

In light of this missing, we propose the very first framework that employs neural architecture search to automatic model design for private deep learning, dubbed as DPNAS. To integrate private learning with architecture search, we delicately design a novel search space and propose a DP-aware method for training candidate models. We empirically certify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

This is motivated by the widespread applications of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world sequential decision making problems, where protecting users' sensitive and private information is becoming paramount. We consider two variants of DP -- joint DP (JDP), where a centralized agent is responsible for protecting users' sensitive data and local DP (LDP), where information needs to be protected directly on the user side. We first propose two general frameworks -- one for policy optimization and another for value iteration -- for designing private, optimistic RL algorithms. We then instantiate these frameworks with suitable privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, and simultaneously obtain sublinear regret guarantees. The regret bounds show that under JDP, the cost of privacy is only a lower order additive term, while for a stronger privacy protection under LDP, the cost suffered is multiplicative. Finally, the regret bounds are obtained by a unified analysis, which, we believe, can be extended beyond tabular MDPs.",[],[],"['Sayak Ray Chowdhury', 'Xingyu Zhou']",[],[]

https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06944,Privacy & Data Governance,On the Impossibility of Non-trivial Accuracy in Presence of Fairness Constraints.,"One of the main concerns about fairness in machine learning (ML) is that, in order to achieve it, one may have to trade off some accuracy. To overcome this issue, Hardt et al. proposed the notion of equality of opportunity (EO), which is compatible with maximal accuracy when the target label is deterministic with respect to the input features. In the probabilistic case, however, the issue is more complicated: It has been shown that under differential privacy constraints, there are data sources for which EO can only be achieved at the total detriment of accuracy, in the sense that a classifier that satisfies EO cannot be more accurate than a trivial (i.e., constant) classifier. In our paper we strengthen this result by removing the privacy constraint. Namely, we show that for certain data sources, the most accurate classifier that satisfies EO is a trivial classifier. Furthermore, we study the trade-off between accuracy and EO loss (opportunity difference), and provide a sufficient condition on the data source under which EO and non-trivial accuracy are compatible.",[],[],"['Carlos Pinzón', 'Catuscia Palamidessi', 'Pablo Piantanida', 'Frank Valencia']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05495,Privacy & Data Governance,How Private Is Your RL Policy? An Inverse RL Based Analysis Framework.,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn how to perform various tasks from scratch. In domains like autonomous driving, recommendation systems, and more, optimal RL policies learned could cause a privacy breach if the policies memorize any part of the private reward. We study the set of existing differentially-private RL policies derived from various RL algorithms such as Value Iteration, Deep Q Networks, and Vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization. We propose a new Privacy-Aware Inverse RL (PRIL) analysis framework, that performs reward reconstruction as an adversarial attack on private policies that the agents may deploy. For this, we introduce the reward reconstruction attack, wherein we seek to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving policy using an Inverse RL algorithm. An adversary must do poorly at reconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private policy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the privacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on multiple instances of the FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed, we infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL. We do so by quantifying the extent to which each private policy protects the reward function by measuring distances between the original and reconstructed rewards.",[],[],"['Kritika Prakash', 'Fiza Husain', 'Praveen Paruchuri', 'Sujit P.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12088,Privacy & Data Governance,SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning.,"Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two popular distributed machine learning approaches. Both follow a model-to-data scenario; clients train and test machine learning models without sharing raw data. SL provides better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore, as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of clients. Besides, the performance of SFL with privacy and robustness measures is further evaluated under extended experimental settings.",[],[],"['Chandra Thapa', 'M.A.P.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09327,Privacy & Data Governance,Incentivizing Collaboration in Machine Learning via Synthetic Data Rewards.,"This paper presents a novel collaborative generative modeling (CGM) framework that incentivizes collaboration among self-interested parties to contribute data to a pool for training a generative model (e.g., GAN), from which synthetic data are drawn and distributed to the parties as rewards commensurate to their contributions. Distributing synthetic data as rewards (instead of trained models or money) offers task- and model-agnostic benefits for downstream learning tasks and is less likely to violate data privacy regulation. To realize the framework, we firstly propose a data valuation function using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) that values data based on its quantity and quality in terms of its closeness to the true data distribution and provide theoretical results guiding the kernel choice in our MMD-based data valuation function. Then, we formulate the reward scheme as a linear optimization problem that when solved, guarantees certain incentives such as fairness in the CGM framework. We devise a weighted sampling algorithm for generating synthetic data to be distributed to each party as reward such that the value of its data and the synthetic data combined matches its assigned reward value by the reward scheme. We empirically show using simulated and real-world datasets that the parties' synthetic data rewards are commensurate to their contributions.",[],[],"['Sebastian Shenghong Tay', 'Xinyi Xu', 'Chuan Sheng Foo', 'Bryan Kian Hsiang Low']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09745,Privacy & Data Governance,Incorporating Item Frequency for Differentially Private Set Union.,"We study the basic operation of set union in the global model of differential privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset $W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing (NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words, sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an instance of the set union problem. Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a $\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the problem.",[],[],"['Sivakanth Gopi', 'Pankaj Gulhane', 'Janardhan Kulkarni', 'Judy Hanwen Shen', 'Milad Shokouhi', 'Sergey Yekhanin']",[],[]

Unfortunately, the research on power side-channels have so far predominantly focused on analyzing implementations of ciphers such as AES, DES, RSA, and recently post-quantum cryptography primitives (e.g., lattices). Meanwhile, machine-learning, and in particular deep-learning applications are becoming ubiquitous with several scenarios where the Machine Learning Models are Intellectual Properties requiring confidentiality. Expanding side-channel analysis to Machine Learning Model extraction, however, is largely unexplored. This paper expands the DPA framework to neural-network classifiers. First, it shows DPA attacks during inference to extract the secret model parameters such as weights and biases of a neural network. Second, it proposes the $\textit{first countermeasures}$ against these attacks by augmenting $\textit{masking}$. The resulting design uses novel masked components such as masked adder trees for fully-connected layers and masked Rectifier Linear Units for activation functions.

This paper presents SeqUST, a novel uncertain-aware self-training framework for NSL to address the labeled data scarcity issue and to effectively utilize unlabeled data. Specifically, we incorporate Monte Carlo (MC) dropout in Bayesian neural network (BNN) to perform uncertainty estimation at the token level and then select reliable language tokens from unlabeled data based on the model confidence and certainty. A well-designed masked sequence labeling task with a noise-robust loss supports robust training, which aims to suppress the problem of noisy pseudo labels. In addition, we develop a Gaussian-based consistency regularization technique to further improve the model robustness on Gaussian-distributed perturbed representations. This effectively alleviates the over-fitting dilemma originating from pseudo-labeled augmented data.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13587,Privacy & Data Governance,Annotation Cost-Sensitive Deep Active Learning with Limited Data (Student Abstract).,"Active learning has been proposed to reduce data annotation efforts by only manually labelling representative data samples for training. Meanwhile, recent active learning applications have benefited a lot from cloud computing services with not only sufficient computational resources but also crowdsourcing frameworks that include many humans in the active learning loop. However, previous active learning methods that always require passing large-scale unlabelled data to cloud may potentially raise significant data privacy issues. To mitigate such a risk, we propose a responsible active learning method, namely Peer Study Learning (PSL), to simultaneously preserve data privacy and improve model stability. Specifically, we first introduce a human-in-the-loop teacher-student architecture to isolate unlabelled data from the task learner (teacher) on the cloud-side by maintaining an active learner (student) on the client-side. During training, the task learner instructs the light-weight active learner which then provides feedback on the active sampling criterion. To further enhance the active learner via large-scale unlabelled data, we introduce multiple peer students into the active learner which is trained by a novel learning paradigm, including the In-Class Peer Study on labelled data and the Out-of-Class Peer Study on unlabelled data. Lastly, we devise a discrepancy-based active sampling criterion, Peer Study Feedback, that exploits the variability of peer students to select the most informative data to improve model stability.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03223,Security,Context-Aware Transfer Attacks for Object Detection.,"Blackbox transfer attacks for image classifiers have been extensively studied in recent years. In contrast, little progress has been made on transfer attacks for object detectors. Object detectors take a holistic view of the image and the detection of one object (or lack thereof) often depends on other objects in the scene. This makes such detectors inherently context-aware and adversarial attacks in this space are more challenging than those targeting image classifiers. In this paper, we present a new approach to generate context-aware attacks for object detectors. We show that by using co-occurrence of objects and their relative locations and sizes as context information, we can successfully generate targeted mis-categorization attacks that achieve higher transfer success rates on blackbox object detectors than the state-of-the-art.

Our TRACE framework streamlines the VidSGG pipeline with a modular design, and presents two unique blocks of Hierarchical Relation Tree (HRTree) construction and Target-adaptive Context Aggregation. More specific, our HRTree first provides an adpative structure for organizing possible relation candidates efficiently, and guides context aggregation module to effectively capture spatio-temporal structure information. Then, we obtain a contextualized feature representation for each relation candidate and build a classification head to recognize its relation category. Finally, we provide a simple temporal association strategy to track TRACE detected results to yield the video-level VidSGG.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15629,Security,Attacking Video Recognition Models with Bullet-Screen Comments.,"Recent research has demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper, the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve about 90\% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition models, while only occluding \textless 8\% areas in the video.

In this paper we design a backdoor attack that alters the saliency map produced by the network for an input image only with injected trigger that is invisible to the naked eye while maintaining the prediction accuracy. The attack relies on injecting poisoned data with a trigger into the training data set. The saliency maps are incorporated in the penalty term of the objective function that is used to train a deep model and its influence on model training is conditioned upon the presence of a trigger. We design two types of attacks: targeted attack that enforces a specific modification of the saliency map and untargeted attack when the importance scores of the top pixels from the original saliency map are significantly reduced. We perform empirical evaluation of the proposed backdoor attacks on gradient-based and gradient-free interpretation methods for a variety of deep learning architectures. We show that our attacks constitute a serious security threat when deploying deep learning models developed by untrusty sources. Finally, in the Supplement we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in an inverted setting, where the correct saliency map can be obtained only in the presence of a trigger (key), effectively making the interpretation system available only to selected users.",[],[],"['Shihong Fang', 'Anna Choromanska']",[],[]

However, the transferability of perturbations from existing methods is still limited, since the adversarial perturbations are easily overfitting with a single surrogate model and specific data pattern. In this paper, we propose a Learning to Learn Transferable Attack (LLTA) method, which makes the adversarial perturbations more generalized via learning from both data and model augmentation. For data augmentation, we adopt simple random resizing and padding. For model augmentation, we randomly alter the back propagation instead of the forward propagation to eliminate the effect on the model prediction. By treating the attack of both specific data and a modified model as a task, we expect the adversarial perturbations to adopt enough tasks for generalization. To this end, the meta-learning algorithm is further introduced during the iteration of perturbation generation. Empirical results on the widely-used dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method with a 12.85% higher success rate of transfer attack compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

We propose PatchUp, a hidden state block-level regularization technique for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that is applied on selected contiguous blocks of feature maps from a random pair of samples. Our approach improves the robustness of CNN models against the manifold intrusion problem that may occur in other state-of-the-art mixing approaches. Moreover, since we are mixing the contiguous block of features in the hidden space, which has more dimensions than the input space, we obtain more diverse samples for training towards different dimensions.

Existing approaches attempt to use frequency information to mine subtle artifacts under high-quality forged faces. However, the exploitation of frequency information is coarse-grained, and more importantly, their vanilla learning process struggles to extract fine-grained forgery traces. To address this issue, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework to exploit both the RGB and fine-grained frequency clues. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained decomposition of RGB images to completely decouple the real and fake traces in the frequency space. Subsequently, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework based on a two-branch network, combined with self-enhancement and mutual-enhancement modules. The self-enhancement module captures the traces in different input spaces based on spatial noise enhancement and channel attention. The Mutual-enhancement module concurrently enhances RGB and frequency features by communicating in the shared spatial dimension. The progressive enhancement process facilitates the learning of discriminative features with fine-grained face forgery clues.

To mitigate these threats, recent studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability, meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with existing ones.

Our algorithm shifts the time of the original events and generates additional adversarial events. Additional adversarial events are generated in two stages. First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate additional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the number of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial events are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) become popular to hallucinate details. Most methods along this line rely on a predefined single-LR-single-HR mapping, which is not flexible enough for the SISR task. Also, GAN-generated fake details may often undermine the realism of the whole image. We address these issues by proposing best-buddy GANs (Beby-GAN) for rich-detail SISR. Relaxing the immutable one-to-one constraint, we allow the estimated patches to dynamically seek the best supervision during training, which is beneficial to producing more reasonable details. Besides, we propose a region-aware adversarial learning strategy that directs our model to focus on generating details for textured areas adaptively.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06831,Security,Parallel and High-Fidelity Text-to-Lip Generation.,"As a key component of talking face generation, lip movements generation determines the naturalness and coherence of the generated talking face video. Prior literature mainly focuses on speech-to-lip generation while there is a paucity in text-to-lip (T2L) generation. T2L is a challenging task and existing end-to-end works depend on the attention mechanism and autoregressive (AR) decoding manner. However, the AR decoding manner generates current lip frame conditioned on frames generated previously, which inherently hinders the inference speed, and also has a detrimental effect on the quality of generated lip frames due to error propagation. This encourages the research of parallel T2L generation. In this work, we propose a parallel decoding model for fast and high-fidelity text-to-lip generation (ParaLip). Specifically, we predict the duration of the encoded linguistic features and model the target lip frames conditioned on the encoded linguistic features with their duration in a non-autoregressive manner. Furthermore, we incorporate the structural similarity index loss and adversarial learning to improve perceptual quality of generated lip frames and alleviate the blurry prediction problem.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14894,Security,Feature Generation and Hypothesis Verification for Reliable Face Anti-spoofing.,"Although existing face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods achieve high accuracy in intra-domain experiments, their effects drop severely in cross-domain scenarios because of poor generalization. Recently, multifarious techniques have been explored, such as domain generalization and representation disentanglement. However, the improvement is still limited by two issues: 1) It is difficult to perfectly map all faces to a shared feature space. If faces from unknown domains are not mapped to the known region in the shared feature space, accidentally inaccurate predictions will be obtained. 2) It is hard to completely consider various spoof traces for disentanglement. In this paper, we propose a Feature Generation and Hypothesis Verification framework to alleviate the two issues. Above all, feature generation networks which generate hypotheses of real faces and known attacks are introduced for the first time in the FAS task. Subsequently, two hypothesis verification modules are applied to judge whether the input face comes from the real-face space and the real-face distribution respectively. Furthermore, some analyses of the relationship between our framework and Bayesian uncertainty estimation are given, which provides theoretical support for reliable defense in unknown domains. Experimental results show our framework achieves promising results and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on extensive public datasets.",[],[],"['Shice Liu', 'Shitao Lu', 'Hongyi Xu', 'Jing Yang', 'Shouhong Ding', 'Lizhuang Ma']",[],[]

Previous works always formulate face forgery detection as a classification problem based on cross-entropy loss, which emphasizes category-level differences rather than the essential discrepancies between real and fake faces, limiting model generalization in unseen domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel face forgery detection framework, named Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL), which specially constructs positive and negative paired data and performs designed contrastive learning at different granularities to learn generalized feature representation. Concretely, combined with the hard sample selection strategy, Inter-Instance Contrastive Learning (Inter-ICL) is first proposed to promote task-related discriminative features learning by especially constructing instance pairs. Moreover, to further explore the essential discrepancies, Intra-Instance Contrastive Learning (Intra-ICL) is introduced to focus on the local content inconsistencies prevalent in the forged faces by constructing local-region pairs inside instances.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05830,Security,Adversarial Bone Length Attack on Action Recognition.,"Skeleton-based action recognition models have recently been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Compared to adversarial attacks on images, perturbations to skeletons are typically bounded to a lower dimension of approximately 100 per frame. This lower-dimensional setting makes it more difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations. Existing attacks resolve this by exploiting the temporal structure of the skeleton motion so that the perturbation dimension increases to thousands. In this paper, we show that adversarial attacks can be performed on skeleton-based action recognition models, even in a significantly low-dimensional setting without any temporal manipulation. Specifically, we restrict the perturbations to the lengths of the skeleton's bones, which allows an adversary to manipulate only approximately 30 effective dimensions. We conducted experiments on the NTU RGB+D and HDM05 datasets and demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully deceived models with sometimes greater than 90% success rate by small perturbations. Furthermore, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: in our low-dimensional setting, the adversarial training with the bone length attack shares a similar property with data augmentation, and it not only improves the adversarial robustness but also improves the classification accuracy on the original data. This is an interesting counterexample of the trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which has been widely observed in studies on adversarial training in the high-dimensional regime.",[],[],"['Nariki Tanaka', 'Hiroshi Kera', 'Kazuhiko Kawamoto']",[],[]

However, most previous works focus on hiding the objects from the detector by generating an individual adversarial patch, which only covers the planar part of the vehicle's surface and fails to attack the detector in physical scenarios for multi-view, long-distance and partially occluded objects. To bridge the gap between digital attacks and physical attacks, we exploit the full 3D vehicle surface to propose a robust Full-coverage Camouflage Attack (FCA) to fool detectors. Specifically, we first try rendering the nonplanar camouflage texture over the full vehicle surface. To mimic the real-world environment conditions, we then introduce a transformation function to transfer the rendered camouflaged vehicle into a photo realistic scenario. Finally, we design an efficient loss function to optimize the camouflage texture. Experiments show that the full-coverage camouflage attack can not only outperform state-of-the-art methods under various test cases but also generalize to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09075,Security,Boosting the Transferability of Video Adversarial Examples via Temporal Translation.,"Although deep-learning based video recognition models have achieved remarkable success, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples that are generated by adding human-imperceptible perturbations on clean video samples. As indicated in recent studies, adversarial examples are transferable, which makes it feasible for black-box attacks in real-world applications. Nevertheless, most existing adversarial attack methods have poor transferability when attacking other video models and transfer-based attacks on video models are still unexplored. To this end, we propose to boost the transferability of video adversarial examples for black-box attacks on video recognition models. Through extensive analysis, we discover that different video recognition models rely on different discriminative temporal patterns, leading to the poor transferability of video adversarial examples. This motivates us to introduce a temporal translation attack method, which optimizes the adversarial perturbations over a set of temporal translated video clips. By generating adversarial examples over translated videos, the resulting adversarial examples are less sensitive to temporal patterns existed in the white-box model being attacked and thus can be better transferred. Extensive experiments on the Kinetics-400 dataset and the UCF-101 dataset demonstrate that our method can significantly boost the transferability of video adversarial examples. For transfer-based attack against video recognition models, it achieves a 61.56% average attack success rate on the Kinetics-400 and 48.60% on the UCF-101.

In this paper, we posit that adversarial attacks on transformers should be specially tailored for their architecture, jointly considering both patches and self-attention, in order to achieve high transferability. More specifically, we introduce a dual attack framework, which contains a Pay No Attention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut attack, to improve the transferability of adversarial samples across different ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients of attention during backpropagation can generate adversarial examples with high transferability. In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing randomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack success rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability of attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can greatly boost transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14230,Security,Patch Diffusion: A General Module for Face Manipulation Detection.,"Face manipulation detection has been receiving a lot of attention for the reliability and security of the face images. Recent studies focus on using auxiliary information or prior knowledge to capture robust manipulation traces, which are shown to be promising. As one of the important face features, the face depth map, which has shown to be effective in other areas such as the face recognition or face detection, is unfortunately paid little attention to in literature for detecting the manipulated face images. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating the face depth map as auxiliary information to tackle the problem of face manipulation detection in real world applications. To this end, we first propose a Face Depth Map Transformer (FDMT) to estimate the face depth map patch by patch from a RGB face image, which is able to capture the local depth anomaly created due to manipulation. The estimated face depth map is then considered as auxiliary information to be integrated with the backbone features using a Multi-head Depth Attention (MDA) mechanism that is newly designed.

However, most of the approaches based on fast gradient sign attack series cannot balance the indistinguishability and transferability due to the limitations of the basic sign structure. To address this problem, we propose a method, called Adam Iterative Fast Gradient Tanh Method (AI-FGTM), to generate indistinguishable adversarial examples with high transferability. Besides, smaller kernels and dynamic step size are also applied to generate adversarial examples for further increasing the attack success rates. Extensive experiments on an ImageNet-compatible dataset show that our method generates more indistinguishable adversarial examples and achieves higher attack success rates without extra running time and resource. Our best transfer-based attack NI-TI-DI-AITM can fool six classic defense models with an average success rate of 89.3% and three advanced defense models with an average success rate of 82.7%, which are higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks. Additionally, our method can also reduce nearly 20% mean perturbation.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06332,Security,Achieving Zero Constraint Violation for Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Primal-Dual Approach.,"Reinforcement learning is widely used in applications where one needs to perform sequential decisions while interacting with the environment. The problem becomes more challenging when the decision requirement includes satisfying some safety constraints. The problem is mathematically formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In the literature, various algorithms are available to solve CMDP problems in a model-free manner to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with $\epsilon$ feasible policies. An $\epsilon$-feasible policy implies that it suffers from constraint violation. An important question here is whether we can achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations or not. To achieve that, we advocate the use of randomized primal-dual approach to solve the CMDP problems and propose a conservative stochastic primal-dual algorithm (CSPDA) which is shown to exhibit $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations. In the prior works, the best available sample complexity for the $\epsilon$-optimal policy with zero constraint violation is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^5\right)$.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09574,Security,The SoftCumulative Constraint with Quadratic Penalty.,"Recent advances in constrained reinforcement learning (RL) have endowed reinforcement learning with certain safety guarantees. However, deploying existing constrained RL algorithms in continuous control tasks with general hard constraints remains challenging, particularly in those situations with non-convex hard constraints. Inspired by the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm, a classical constrained optimization technique, we propose a reduced policy optimization (RPO) algorithm that combines RL with GRG to address general hard constraints. RPO partitions actions into basic actions and nonbasic actions following the GRG method and outputs the basic actions via a policy network. Subsequently, RPO calculates the nonbasic actions by solving equations based on equality constraints using the obtained basic actions. The policy network is then updated by implicitly differentiating nonbasic actions with respect to basic actions. Additionally, we introduce an action projection procedure based on the reduced gradient and apply a modified Lagrangian relaxation technique to ensure inequality constraints are satisfied. To the best of our knowledge, RPO is the first attempt that introduces GRG to RL as a way of efficiently handling both equality and inequality hard constraints. It is worth noting that there is currently a lack of RL environments with complex hard constraints, which motivates us to develop three new benchmarks: two robotics manipulation tasks and a smart grid operation control task. With these benchmarks, RPO achieves better performance than previous constrained RL algorithms in terms of both cumulative reward and constraint violation. We believe RPO, along with the new benchmarks, will open up new opportunities for applying RL to real-world problems with complex constraints.",[],[],"['Shutong Ding', 'Jingya Wang', 'Yali Du', 'Ye Shi']",[],[]

To this end, we consider a rarely investigated but more rigorous setting, namely hard-label attack, in which the attacker can only access the prediction label. In particular, we find we can learn the importance of different words via the change on prediction label caused by word substitutions on the adversarial examples. Based on this observation, we propose a novel adversarial attack, termed Text Hard-label attacker (TextHacker). TextHacker randomly perturbs lots of words to craft an adversarial example. Then, TextHacker adopts a hybrid local search algorithm with the estimation of word importance from the attack history to minimize the adversarial perturbation. Extensive evaluations for text classification and textual entailment show that TextHacker significantly outperforms existing hard-label attacks regarding the attack performance as well as adversary quality.",[],[],"['Zhen Yu', 'Xiaosen Wang', 'Wanxiang Che', 'Kun He']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12846,Security,HAGEN: Homophily-Aware Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Crime Forecasting.,"The crime forecasting is an important problem as it greatly contributes to urban safety. Typically, the goal of the problem is to predict different types of crimes for each geographical region (like a neighborhood or censor tract) in the near future. Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic characteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art solutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques could effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region nodes in the graph. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph cannot fully capture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but share similar crime patterns. Hence, to make an accurate crime prediction, the main challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between regions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from historical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs for crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the crime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining an adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN, we propose a homophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph so that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime patterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. It also incorporates crime embedding to model the interdependencies between regions and crime categories. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN.",[],[],"['Chenyu Wang', 'Zongyu Lin', 'Xiaochen Yang', 'Jiao Sun', 'Mingxuan Yue', 'Cyrus Shahabi']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02486,Security,Unsupervised Adversarially Robust Representation Learning on Graphs.,"Unsupervised/self-supervised pre-training methods for graph representation learning have recently attracted increasing research interests, and they are shown to be able to generalize to various downstream applications. Yet, the adversarial robustness of such pre-trained graph learning models remains largely unexplored. More importantly, most existing defense techniques designed for end-to-end graph representation learning methods require pre-specified label definitions, and thus cannot be directly applied to the pre-training methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised defense technique to robustify pre-trained deep graph models, so that the perturbations on the input graph can be successfully identified and blocked before the model is applied to different downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce a mutual information-based measure, \textit{graph representation vulnerability (GRV)}, to quantify the robustness of graph encoders on the representation space. We then formulate an optimization problem to learn the graph representation by carefully balancing the trade-off between the expressive power and the robustness (\emph{i.e.}, GRV) of the graph encoder. The discrete nature of graph topology and the joint space of graph data make the optimization problem intractable to solve. To handle the above difficulty and to reduce computational expense, we further relax the problem and thus provide an approximate solution. Additionally, we explore a provable connection between the robustness of the unsupervised graph encoder and that of models on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even without access to labels and tasks, our model is still able to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks on three downstream tasks (node classification, link prediction, and community detection) by an average of +16.5% compared with existing methods.",[],[],"['Jiarong Xu', 'Yang Yang', 'Junru Chen', 'Chunping Wang', 'Xin Jiang', 'Jiangang Lu', 'Yizhou Sun']",[],[]

Existing works assume the attacker is either (partly) aware of the victim model, or able to send queries to it. These assumptions are, however, unrealistic. To bridge the gap between theoretical graph attacks and real-world scenarios, in this work, we propose a novel and more realistic setting: strict black-box graph attack, in which the attacker has no knowledge about the victim model at all and is not allowed to send any queries. To design such an attack strategy, we first propose a generic graph filter to unify different families of graph-based models. The strength of attacks can then be quantified by the change in the graph filter before and after attack. By maximizing this change, we are able to find an effective attack strategy, regardless of the underlying model. To solve this optimization problem, we also propose a relaxation technique and approximation theories to reduce the difficulty as well as the computational expense. Experiments demonstrate that, even with no exposure to the model, the Macro-F1 drops 6.4% in node classification and 29.5% in graph classification, which is a significant result compared with existent works.",[],[],"['Jiarong Xu', 'Yizhou Sun', 'Xin Jiang', 'Yanhao Wang', 'Yang Yang', 'Chunping Wang', 'Jiangang Lu']",[],[]

Such helpful information can boost our understandings about the temporal evolution and spatial factors of urban crimes and can enhance accurate crime prediction. In this paper, we perform crime prediction exploiting the cross-type and spatio-temporal correlations of urban crimes. In particular, we verify the existence of correlations among different types of crime from temporal and spatial perspectives, and propose a coherent framework to mathematically model these correlations for crime prediction.

However, GCNs may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks on label-scarce dynamic graphs. Many existing works aim to strengthen the robustness of GCNs; for instance, adversarial training is used to shield GCNs against malicious perturbations. However, these works fail on dynamic graphs for which label scarcity is a pressing issue. To overcome label scarcity, self-training attempts to iteratively assign pseudo-labels to highly confident unlabeled nodes but such attempts may suffer serious degradation under dynamic graph perturbations. In this paper, we generalize noisy supervision as a kind of self-supervised learning method and then propose a novel Bayesian self-supervision model, namely GraphSS, to address the issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSS can not only affirmatively alert the perturbations on dynamic graphs but also effectively recover the prediction of a node classifier when the graph is under such perturbations.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06017,Security,DeepHardMark: Towards Watermarking Neural Network Hardware.,"Logic locking has been proposed to safeguard intellectual property (IP) during chip fabrication. Logic locking techniques protect hardware IP by making a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural accelerator it protects. Specifically, we show how the deterministic errors caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on several locked accelerators. In our largest benchmark accelerator, our attack identified a trojan key that caused a 74\% decrease in classification accuracy for attacker-specified trigger inputs, while degrading accuracy by only 1.7\% for other inputs on average.",[],[],"['Hongye Xu', 'Dongfang Liu', 'Cory Merkel', 'Michael Zuzak']",[],[]

For the resulting strategic game among the leaders, we show that pure Nash equilibria may fail to exist and therefore, we consider approximate equilibria instead. As our first main result, we show that the existence of a $K$-approximate equilibrium can always be guaranteed, where $K \approx 1.1974$ is the unique solution of a cubic polynomial equation. To this end, we give a polynomial time combinatorial algorithm which computes a $K$-approximate equilibrium. The factor $K$ is tight, meaning that there is an instance that does not admit an $\alpha$-approximate equilibrium for any $\alpha<K$. Thus $\alpha=K$ is the smallest possible value of $\alpha$ such that the existence of an $\alpha$-approximate equilibrium can be guaranteed for any instance of the considered game.

To alleviate these concerns, we apply \textit{subgame resolving}, a technique extremely successful in finding NE in zero-sum games to solving general-sum EFCEs. Subgame resolving refines a correlation plan in an \textit{online} manner: instead of solving for the full game upfront, it only solves for strategies in subgames that are reached in actual play, resulting in significant computational gains. In this paper, we (i) lay out the foundations to quantify the quality of a refined strategy, in terms of the \textit{social welfare} and \textit{exploitability} of correlation plans, (ii) show that EFCEs possess a sufficient amount of independence between subgames to perform resolving efficiently, and (iii) provide two algorithms for resolving, one using linear programming and the other based on regret minimization.

We show that the problem of finding an optimal interdiction strategy for the defender in the rational setting is NP-hard. The resulting optimization is in fact non-convex and additionally, involves complex terms that sum over exponentially many paths. We tackle these computational challenges by presenting new efficient approximation algorithms with bounded solution guarantees. First, we address the exponentially-many-path challenge by proposing a polynomial-time dynamic programming-based formulation. We then show that the gradient of the non-convex objective can also be computed in polynomial time, which allows us to use a gradient-based method to solve the problem efficiently.

However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model to deviate from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate the prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these.

In this paper, we propose an approach to performing crowd annotation learning for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) to make full use of the noisy sequence labels from multiple annotators. Inspired by adversarial learning, our approach uses a common Bi-LSTM and a private Bi-LSTM for representing annotator-generic and -specific information. The annotator-generic information is the common knowledge for entities easily mastered by the crowd. Finally, we build our Chinese NE tagger based on the LSTM-CRF model. In our experiments, we create two data sets for Chinese NER tasks from two domains.

Stability is a crucial property for safety-critical dynamical systems, while stabilization of partially observed systems, in many cases, requires controllers to retain and process long-term memories of the past. We consider the important class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as dynamic controllers for nonlinear uncertain partially-observed systems, and derive convex stability conditions based on integral quadratic constraints, S-lemma and sequential convexification. To ensure stability during the learning and control process, we propose a projected policy gradient method that iteratively enforces the stability conditions in the reparametrized space taking advantage of mild additional information on system dynamics. Numerical experiments show that our method learns stabilizing controllers while using fewer samples and achieving higher final performance compared with policy gradient.",[],[],"['Fangda Gu', 'He Yin', 'Laurent El Ghaoui', 'Murat Arcak', 'Peter Seiler', 'Ming Jin']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07701,Security,Conservative and Adaptive Penalty for Model-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning.,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in the real world must satisfy safety constraints in addition to maximizing a reward objective. Model-based RL algorithms hold promise for reducing unsafe real-world actions: they may synthesize policies that obey all constraints using simulated samples from a learned model. However, imperfect models can result in real-world constraint violations even for actions that are predicted to satisfy all constraints. We propose Conservative and Adaptive Penalty (CAP), a model-based safe RL framework that accounts for potential modeling errors by capturing model uncertainty and adaptively exploiting it to balance the reward and the cost objectives. First, CAP inflates predicted costs using an uncertainty-based penalty. Theoretically, we show that policies that satisfy this conservative cost constraint are guaranteed to also be feasible in the true environment. We further show that this guarantees the safety of all intermediate solutions during RL training. Further, CAP adaptively tunes this penalty during training using true cost feedback from the environment. We evaluate this conservative and adaptive penalty-based approach for model-based safe RL extensively on state and image-based environments. Our results demonstrate substantial gains in sample-efficiency while incurring fewer violations than prior safe RL algorithms.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01642,Security,Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning with Dissipation Inequation Constraint.,"Robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts is a long-standing goal of Reinforcement Learning (RL). To this end, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) trains a protagonist against destabilizing forces exercised by an adversary in a competitive zero-sum Markov game, whose optimal solution, i.e., rational strategy, corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. However, finding Nash equilibria requires facing complex saddle point optimization problems, which can be prohibitive to solve, especially for high-dimensional control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for adversarial RL based on entropy regularization to ease the complexity of the saddle point optimization problem. We show that the solution of this entropy-regularized problem corresponds to a Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), a generalization of Nash equilibria that accounts for bounded rationality, i.e., agents sometimes play random actions instead of optimal ones. Crucially, the connection between the entropy-regularized objective and QRE enables free modulation of the rationality of the agents by simply tuning the temperature coefficient. We leverage this insight to propose our novel algorithm, Quantal Adversarial RL (QARL), which gradually increases the rationality of the adversary in a curriculum fashion until it is fully rational, easing the complexity of the optimization problem while retaining robustness. We provide extensive evidence of QARL outperforming RARL and recent baselines across several MuJoCo locomotion and navigation problems in overall performance and robustness.",[],[],"['Aryaman Reddi', 'Maximilian Tölle', 'Jan Peters', 'Georgia Chalvatzaki', ""Carlo D'Eramo""]",[],[]

The complexity of these systems coupled with our high dependency on them implies both a non-negligible likelihood of system failures, and a high potential that such failures have significant negative effects on our everyday life. For that reason, it is a vital requirement to keep the harm of emerging failures to a minimum, which means minimizing the system downtime as well as the cost of system repair. This is where model-based diagnosis comes into play. Model-based diagnosis is a principled, domain-independent approach that can be generally applied to troubleshoot systems of a wide variety of types, including all the ones mentioned above, and many more. It exploits and orchestrates i.a. techniques for knowledge representation, automated reasoning, heuristic problem solving, intelligent search, optimization, stochastics, statistics, decision making under uncertainty, machine learning, as well as calculus, combinatorics and set theory to detect, localize, and fix faults in abnormally behaving systems.

Inspired by the fact that these adversaries are constructed by iteratively minimizing the confidence of a network for the true class label, we propose the anti-adversary layer, aimed at countering this effect. In particular, our layer generates an input perturbation in the opposite direction of the adversarial one and feeds the classifier a perturbed version of the input. Our approach is training-free and theoretically supported. We verify the effectiveness of our approach by combining our layer with both nominally and robustly trained models and conduct large-scale experiments from black-box to adaptive attacks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02185,Security,Admissible Policy Teaching through Reward Design.,"We study reward design strategies for incentivizing a reinforcement learning agent to adopt a policy from a set of admissible policies. The goal of the reward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently while ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the new reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward function. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the reward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are inadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward design problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging, and it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then proceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates the optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more amenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem, we present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the optimal solution. Finally, we design a local search algorithm to solve the surrogate problem and showcase its utility using simulation-based experiments.",[],[],"['Kiarash Banihashem', 'Adish Singla', 'Jiarui Gan', 'Goran Radanovic']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06804,Security,Entropy-Based Logic Explanations of Neural Networks.,"Explainable artificial intelligence has rapidly emerged since lawmakers have started requiring interpretable models for safety-critical domains. Concept-based neural networks have arisen as explainable-by-design methods as they leverage human-understandable symbols (i.e. concepts) to predict class memberships. However, most of these approaches focus on the identification of the most relevant concepts but do not provide concise, formal explanations of how such concepts are leveraged by the classifier to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable approach enabling the extraction of logic explanations from neural networks using the formalism of First-Order Logic. The method relies on an entropy-based criterion which automatically identifies the most relevant concepts. We consider four different case studies to demonstrate that: (i) this entropy-based criterion enables the distillation of concise logic explanations in safety-critical domains from clinical data to computer vision; (ii) the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art white-box models in terms of classification accuracy and matches black box performances.",[],[],"['Pietro Barbiero', 'Gabriele Ciravegna', 'Francesco Giannini', 'Pietro Lió', 'Marco Gori', 'Stefano Melacci']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07430,Security,Safe Online Convex Optimization with Unknown Linear Safety Constraints.,"We study the problem of safe online convex optimization, where the action at each time step must satisfy a set of linear safety constraints. The goal is to select a sequence of actions to minimize the regret without violating the safety constraints at any time step (with high probability). The parameters that specify the linear safety constraints are unknown to the algorithm. The algorithm has access to only the noisy observations of constraints for the chosen actions. We propose an algorithm, called the {Safe Online Projected Gradient Descent} (SO-PGD) algorithm, to address this problem. We show that, under the assumption of the availability of a safe baseline action, the SO-PGD algorithm achieves a regret $O(T^{2/3})$. While there are many algorithms for online convex optimization (OCO) problems with safety constraints available in the literature, they allow constraint violations during learning/optimization, and the focus has been on characterizing the cumulative constraint violations.

However, it suffers from high computational costs due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with the same training schedule).",[],[],"['Jinghui Chen', 'Yu Cheng', 'Zhe Gan', 'Quanquan Gu', 'Jingjing Liu']",[],[]

In well-behaved settings, RL algorithms have convergence guarantees in the limit. While these guarantees are valuable, they are insufficient for safety-critical applications. Furthermore, they are lost when applying advanced techniques such as deep-RL. To recover guarantees when applying advanced RL algorithms to more complex environments with (i) reachability, (ii) safety-constrained reachability, or (iii) discounted-reward objectives, we build upon the DeepMDP framework introduced by Gelada et al. to derive new bisimulation bounds between the unknown environment and a learned discrete latent model of it. Our bisimulation bounds enable the application of formal methods for Markov decision processes. Finally, we show how one can use a policy obtained via state-of-the-art RL to efficiently train a variational autoencoder that yields a discrete latent model with provably approximately correct bisimulation guarantees.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10943,Security,Gradient Based Activations for Accurate Bias-Free Learning.,"Bias mitigation in machine learning models is imperative, yet challenging. While several approaches have been proposed, one view towards mitigating bias is through adversarial learning. A discriminator is used to identify the bias attributes such as gender, age or race in question. This discriminator is used adversarially to ensure that it cannot distinguish the bias attributes. The main drawback in such a model is that it directly introduces a trade-off with accuracy as the features that the discriminator deems to be sensitive for discrimination of bias could be correlated with classification. In this work we solve the problem. We show that a biased discriminator can actually be used to improve this bias-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, this is achieved by using a feature masking approach using the discriminator's gradients. We ensure that the features favoured for the bias discrimination are de-emphasized and the unbiased features are enhanced during classification. We show that this simple approach works well to reduce bias as well as improve accuracy significantly. We evaluate the proposed model on standard benchmarks.

An Inverse RL Based Analysis Framework.,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn how to perform various tasks from scratch. In domains like autonomous driving, recommendation systems, and more, optimal RL policies learned could cause a privacy breach if the policies memorize any part of the private reward. We study the set of existing differentially-private RL policies derived from various RL algorithms such as Value Iteration, Deep Q Networks, and Vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization. We propose a new Privacy-Aware Inverse RL (PRIL) analysis framework, that performs reward reconstruction as an adversarial attack on private policies that the agents may deploy. For this, we introduce the reward reconstruction attack, wherein we seek to reconstruct the original reward from a privacy-preserving policy using an Inverse RL algorithm. An adversary must do poorly at reconstructing the original reward function if the agent uses a tightly private policy. Using this framework, we empirically test the effectiveness of the privacy guarantee offered by the private algorithms on multiple instances of the FrozenLake domain of varying complexities. Based on the analysis performed, we infer a gap between the current standard of privacy offered and the standard of privacy needed to protect reward functions in RL. We do so by quantifying the extent to which each private policy protects the reward function by measuring distances between the original and reconstructed rewards.",[],[],"['Kritika Prakash', 'Fiza Husain', 'Praveen Paruchuri', 'Sujit P.

We consider a strong attacker model in which the attacker can observe both the selected actions and their corresponding rewards and can contaminate the rewards with additive noise. We show that any bandit algorithm with regret $O(\log T)$ can be forced to suffer a regret $\Omega(T)$ with an expected amount of contamination $O(\log T)$. This amount of contamination is also necessary, as we prove that there exists an $O(\log T)$ regret bandit algorithm, specifically the classical UCB, that requires $\Omega(\log T)$ amount of contamination to suffer regret $\Omega(T)$. To combat such attacks, our second main contribution is to propose verification based mechanisms, which use limited verification to access a limited number of uncontaminated rewards. In particular, for the case of unlimited verifications, we show that with $O(\log T)$ expected number of verifications, a simple modified version of the ETC type bandit algorithm can restore the order optimal $O(\log T)$ regret irrespective of the amount of contamination used by the attacker. We also provide a UCB-like verification scheme, called Secure-UCB, that also enjoys full recovery from any attacks, also with $O(\log T)$ expected number of verifications. To derive a matching lower bound on the number of verifications, we prove that for any order-optimal bandit algorithm, this number of verifications $\Omega(\log T)$ is necessary to recover the order-optimal regret. On the other hand, when the number of verifications is bounded above by a budget $B$, we propose a novel algorithm, Secure-BARBAR, which provably achieves $O(\min\{C,T/\sqrt{B} \})$ regret with high probability against weak attackers where $C$ is the total amount of contamination by the attacker, which breaks the known $\Omega(C)$ lower bound of the non-verified setting if $C$ is large.",[],[],"['Anshuka Rangi', 'Long Tran-Thanh', 'Haifeng Xu', 'Massimo Franceschetti']",[],[]

In parallel, different images are of varied complexity and their different regions can contain various levels of visual information, indicating that treating all regions/tokens equally in terms of model complexity is unnecessary while such opportunities for trimming down ViTs' complexity have not been fully explored. To this end, we propose a Multi-grained Input-adaptive Vision Transformer framework dubbed MIA-Former that can input-adaptively adjust the structure of ViTs at three coarse-to-fine-grained granularities (i.e., model depth and the number of model heads/tokens). In particular, our MIA-Former adopts a low-cost network trained with a hybrid supervised and reinforcement training method to skip unnecessary layers, heads, and tokens in an input adaptive manner, reducing the overall computational cost. Furthermore, an interesting side effect of our MIA-Former is that its resulting ViTs are naturally equipped with improved robustness against adversarial attacks over their static counterparts, because MIA-Former's multi-grained dynamic control improves the model diversity similar to the effect of ensemble and thus increases the difficulty of adversarial attacks against all its sub-models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that the proposed MIA-Former framework can effectively allocate computation budgets adaptive to the difficulty of input images meanwhile increase robustness, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, e.g., 20% computation savings with the same or even a higher accuracy compared with SOTA dynamic transformer models.",[],[],"['Zhongzhi Yu', 'Yonggan Fu', 'Sicheng Li', 'Chaojian Li', 'Yingyan Lin']",[],[]

Understanding and recognising is not only important for interpersonal communication, but also has promising applications in Human-Computer Interaction, automobile safety and medical research. This project focuses on extending the emotion recognition database, and training the CNN + RNN emotion recognition neural networks with emotion category representation and valence \& arousal representation. The combined models are constructed by training the two representations simultaneously. The comparison and analysis between the three types of model are discussed. The inner-relationship between two emotion representations and the interpretability of the neural networks are investigated.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14851,Security,CLPA: Clean-Label Poisoning Availability Attacks Using Generative Adversarial Nets.,"Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against data poisoning attacks. These attacks aim to inject poisoning samples into the models' training dataset such that the trained models have inference failures. While previous studies have executed different types of attacks, one major challenge that greatly limits their effectiveness is the uncertainty of the re-training process after the injection of poisoning samples, including the re-training initialization or algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose a novel attack method called ''Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack (SAPA)''. In particular, it leverages the concept of DNNs' loss landscape sharpness to optimize the poisoning effect on the worst re-trained model. It helps enhance the preservation of the poisoning effect, regardless of the specific retraining procedure employed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAPA offers a general and principled strategy that significantly enhances various types of poisoning attacks.",[],[],"['Pengfei He', 'Han Xu', 'Jie Ren', 'Yingqian Cui', 'Hui Liu', 'Charu C.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03331,Security,FedInv: Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning by Inversing Local Model Updates.,"\textit{Federated learning} (FL) is a nascent distributed learning paradigm to train a shared global model without violating users' privacy. FL has been shown to be vulnerable to various Byzantine attacks, where malicious participants could independently or collusively upload well-crafted updates to deteriorate the performance of the global model. However, existing defenses could only mitigate part of Byzantine attacks, without providing an all-sided shield for FL. It is difficult to simply combine them as they rely on totally contradictory assumptions. In this paper, we propose FPD, a \underline{\textbf{f}}our-\underline{\textbf{p}}ronged \underline{\textbf{d}}efense against both non-colluding and colluding Byzantine attacks. Our main idea is to utilize absolute similarity to filter updates rather than relative similarity used in existingI works. To this end, we first propose a reliable client selection strategy to prevent the majority of threats in the bud. Then we design a simple but effective score-based detection method to mitigate colluding attacks. Third, we construct an enhanced spectral-based outlier detector to accurately discard abnormal updates when the training data is \textit{not independent and identically distributed} (non-IID). Finally, we design update denoising to rectify the direction of the slightly noisy but harmful updates. The four sequentially combined modules can effectively reconcile the contradiction in addressing non-colluding and colluding Byzantine attacks. Extensive experiments over three benchmark image classification datasets against four state-of-the-art Byzantine attacks demonstrate that FPD drastically outperforms existing defenses in IID and non-IID scenarios (with $30\%$ improvement on model accuracy).",[],[],"['Wei Wan', 'Shengshan Hu', 'Minghui Li', 'Jianrong Lu', 'Longling Zhang', 'Leo Yu Zhang', 'Hai Jin']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06537,Security,Well-Classified Examples Are Underestimated in Classification with Deep Neural Networks.,"The conventional wisdom behind learning deep classification models is to focus on bad-classified examples and ignore well-classified examples that are far from the decision boundary. For instance, when training with cross-entropy loss, examples with higher likelihoods (i.e., well-classified examples) contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically show that this common practice hinders representation learning, energy optimization, and margin growth. To counteract this deficiency, we propose to reward well-classified examples with additive bonuses to revive their contribution to the learning process. This counterexample theoretically addresses these three issues. We empirically support this claim by directly verifying the theoretical results or significant performance improvement with our counterexample on diverse tasks, including image classification, graph classification, and machine translation. Furthermore, this paper shows that we can deal with complex scenarios, such as imbalanced classification, OOD detection, and applications under adversarial attacks because our idea can solve these three issues.

We study the shortest path edge interdiction problem for defending Active Directory style attack graphs. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between one defender and one attacker. The attack graph contains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry node is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited by his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The defender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker, where the expectation is taken over entry nodes. We observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum attack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that even if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still $W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum attack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter algorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. We then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the tree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small tree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with multiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a graph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger graphs with more splitting nodes.",[],[],"['Mingyu Guo', 'Jialiang Li', 'Aneta Neumann', 'Frank Neumann', 'Hung Nguyen']",[],[]

To thwart reconnaissance, defenders can employ cyber deception techniques, such as deploying honeypots. In recent years, researchers have made great strides in developing game-theoretic models to find optimal deception strategies. However, most of these game-theoretic models build on relatively simple models of adversarial reconnaissance -- even though reconnaissance should be a focus point as the very purpose of deception is to thwart reconnaissance. In this paper, we first discuss effective cyber reconnaissance mitigation techniques including deception strategies and beyond. Then we provide a review of the literature on deception games from the perspective of modeling adversarial reconnaissance, highlighting key aspects of reconnaissance that have not been adequately captured in prior work. We then describe a probability-theory based model of the adversaries' belief formation and illustrate using numerical examples that this model can capture key aspects of adversarial reconnaissance.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09447,Security,Algorithmic Fairness Verification with Graphical Models.,"In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been deployed in safety-critical and high-stake decision-making, where the fairness of algorithms is of paramount importance. Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias towards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and proposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different fairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been proposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML classifier--essentially beyond a finite dataset--given the probability distribution of input features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers, existing fairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modeling of correlations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations of the classifiers as SSAT/SMT formulas or by sampling. In this paper, we propose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that encodes the correlations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to existing verifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for verifying linear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an accurate and scalable assessment for more diverse families of fairness-enhancing algorithms, fairness attacks, and group/causal fairness metrics than the state-of-the-art fairness verifiers. We also demonstrate that FVGM facilitates the computation of fairness influence functions as a stepping stone to detect the source of bias induced by subsets of features.",[],[],"['Bishwamittra Ghosh', 'Debabrota Basu', 'Kuldeep S.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03765,Security,Certified Robustness of Nearest Neighbors against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks.,"Data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks aim to corrupt a machine learning classifier via modifying, adding, and/or removing some carefully selected training examples, such that the corrupted classifier makes incorrect predictions as the attacker desires. The key idea of state-of-the-art certified defenses against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks is to create a majority vote mechanism to predict the label of a testing example. Moreover, each voter is a base classifier trained on a subset of the training dataset. Classical simple learning algorithms such as k nearest neighbors (kNN) and radius nearest neighbors (rNN) have intrinsic majority vote mechanisms. In this work, we show that the intrinsic majority vote mechanisms in kNN and rNN already provide certified robustness guarantees against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks. Moreover, our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the intrinsic certified robustness guarantees of kNN and rNN outperform those provided by state-of-the-art certified defenses.

Unfortunately, the research on power side-channels have so far predominantly focused on analyzing implementations of ciphers such as AES, DES, RSA, and recently post-quantum cryptography primitives (e.g., lattices). Meanwhile, machine-learning, and in particular deep-learning applications are becoming ubiquitous with several scenarios where the Machine Learning Models are Intellectual Properties requiring confidentiality. Expanding side-channel analysis to Machine Learning Model extraction, however, is largely unexplored. This paper expands the DPA framework to neural-network classifiers. First, it shows DPA attacks during inference to extract the secret model parameters such as weights and biases of a neural network. Second, it proposes the $\textit{first countermeasures}$ against these attacks by augmenting $\textit{masking}$. The resulting design uses novel masked components such as masked adder trees for fully-connected layers and masked Rectifier Linear Units for activation functions.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12662,Security,Sampling-Based Robust Control of Autonomous Systems with Non-Gaussian Noise.,"Controllers for autonomous systems that operate in safety-critical settings must account for stochastic disturbances. Such disturbances are often modelled as process noise, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel planning method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target. First, we abstract the continuous system into a discrete-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP, and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the autonomous system. Realistic benchmarks show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has millions of states or transitions.",[],[],"['Thom S.

In a canonical application, for example, planning for autonomous vehicles is used to automate the static or continuous planning towards performance, resource management, or functional goals (e.g., arriving at the destination, managing fuel fuel consumption). Existing planning algorithms assume non-adversarial settings; a least-cost plan is developed based on available environmental information (i.e., the input instance). Yet, it is unclear how such algorithms will perform in the face of adversaries attempting to thwart the planner. In this paper, we explore the security of planning algorithms used in cyber- and cyber-physical systems. We present two $\textit{adversarial planning}$ algorithms-one static and one adaptive-that perturb input planning instances to maximize cost (often substantially so). We evaluate the performance of the algorithms against two dominant planning algorithms used in commercial applications (D* Lite and Fast Downward) and show both are vulnerable to extremely limited adversarial action. Here, experiments show that an adversary is able to increase plan costs in 66.9% of instances by only removing a single action from the actions space (D* Lite) and render 70% of instances from an international planning competition unsolvable by removing only three actions (Fast Forward).

https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02563,Security,A Novel Approach to Solving Goal-Achieving Problems for Board Games.,"Goal-achieving problems are puzzles that set up a specific situation with a clear objective. An example that is well-studied is the category of life-and-death (L&D) problems for Go, which helps players hone their skill of identifying region safety. Many previous methods like lambda search try null moves first, then derive so-called relevance zones (RZs), outside of which the opponent does not need to search. This paper first proposes a novel RZ-based approach, called the RZ-Based Search (RZS), to solving L&D problems for Go. RZS tries moves before determining whether they are null moves post-hoc. This means we do not need to rely on null move heuristics, resulting in a more elegant algorithm, so that it can also be seamlessly incorporated into AlphaZero's super-human level play in our solver. To repurpose AlphaZero for solving, we also propose a new training method called Faster to Life (FTL), which modifies AlphaZero to entice it to win more quickly. We use RZS and FTL to solve L&D problems on Go, namely solving 68 among 106 problems from a professional L&D book while a previous program solves 11 only. Finally, we discuss that the approach is generic in the sense that RZS is applicable to solving many other goal-achieving problems for board games.",[],[],"['Chung-Chin Shih', 'Ti-Rong Wu', 'Ting Han Wei', 'I-Chen Wu']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12709,Security,Adversarial Training for Improving Model Robustness? Look at Both Prediction and Interpretation.,"Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are semantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced by their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial training which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a target model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these adversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to make a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial example pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two similar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave consistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same predictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by consistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a bottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words. FLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in original/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global word importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving the robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four neural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks on four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better robustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across different attacks.",[],[],"['Hanjie Chen', 'Yangfeng Ji']",[],[]

However, the realistic use cases for fact-checkers will require verifying claims against evidence sources that could be affected by the same misinformation. Furthermore, the development of modern NLP tools that can produce coherent, fabricated content would allow malicious actors to systematically generate adversarial disinformation for fact-checkers. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of automated fact-checkers to synthetic adversarial evidence in two simulated settings: AdversarialAddition, where we fabricate documents and add them to the evidence repository available to the fact-checking system, and AdversarialModification, where existing evidence source documents in the repository are automatically altered.

Thus, NLG APIs have already become essential profitable services in many commercial companies. Due to the substantial financial and intellectual investments, service providers adopt a pay-as-you-use policy to promote sustainable market growth. However, recent works have shown that cloud platforms suffer from financial losses imposed by model extraction attacks, which aim to imitate the functionality and utility of the victim services, thus violating the intellectual property (IP) of cloud APIs. This work targets at protecting IP of NLG APIs by identifying the attackers who have utilized watermarked responses from the victim NLG APIs. However, most existing watermarking techniques are not directly amenable for IP protection of NLG APIs. To bridge this gap, we first present a novel watermarking method for text generation APIs by conducting lexical modification to the original outputs. Compared with the competitive baselines, our watermark approach achieves better identifiable performance in terms of p-value, with fewer semantic losses. In addition, our watermarks are more understandable and intuitive to humans than the baselines.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16630,Security,Word Level Robustness Enhancement: Fight Perturbation with Perturbation.,"The language models, especially the basic text classification models, have been shown to be susceptible to textual adversarial attacks such as synonym substitution and word insertion attacks. To defend against such attacks, a growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness. However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing (NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\ell_0$ perturbations in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against synonym substitution attacks.",[],[],"['Xinyu Zhang', 'Hanbin Hong', 'Yuan Hong', 'Peng Huang', 'Binghui Wang', 'Zhongjie Ba', 'Kui Ren']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10424,Security,Unifying Model Explainability and Robustness for Joint Text Classification and Rationale Extraction.,"Recent works have shown explainability and robustness are two crucial ingredients of trustworthy and reliable text classification. However, previous works usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales for explainability while being beneficial to prediction; ii) how to make the predictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively, a model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against adversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs explanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end, we propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC. It includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to use various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the model's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate rationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information. Performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC outperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a large margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the attack success rate effectively by up to 69%.

A recent line of work, detection-based defense, aims to distinguish adversarial sentences from benign ones. However, {the core limitation of previous detection methods is being incapable of giving correct predictions on adversarial sentences unlike defense methods from other paradigms.} To solve this issue, this paper proposes TextShield: (1) we discover a link between text attack and saliency information, and then we propose a saliency-based detector, which can effectively detect whether an input sentence is adversarial or not. (2) We design a saliency-based corrector, which converts the detected adversary sentences to benign ones. By combining the saliency-based detector and corrector, TextShield extends the detection-only paradigm to a detection-correction paradigm, thus filling the gap in the existing detection-based defense.

Recently, it has been shown that there also exist input-agnostic attacks in NLP models, called universal adversarial triggers. However, existing methods to craft universal triggers are data intensive. They require large amounts of data samples to generate adversarial triggers, which are typically inaccessible by attackers. For instance, previous works take 3000 data samples per class for the SNLI dataset to generate adversarial triggers. In this paper, we present a novel data-free approach, MINIMAL, to mine input-agnostic adversarial triggers from models. Using the triggers produced with our data-free algorithm, we reduce the accuracy of Stanford Sentiment Treebank's positive class from 93.6% to 9.6%.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08900,Security,A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information: Application to Crop Yield Prediction.,"Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning baselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep learning methods and comparing their performance. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.",[],[],"['Joshua Fan', 'Junwen Bai', 'Zhiyun Li', 'Ariel Ortiz-Bobea', 'Carla P.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19986,Security,Has CEO Gender Bias Really Been Fixed? Adversarial Attacking and Improving Gender Fairness in Image Search.,"Machine learning (ML) technologies are known to be riddled with ethical and operational problems, however, we are witnessing an increasing thrust by businesses to deploy them in sensitive applications. One major issue among many is that ML models do not perform equally well for underrepresented groups. This puts vulnerable populations in an even disadvantaged and unfavorable position. We propose an approach that leverages the power of web search and generative models to alleviate some of the shortcomings of discriminative models. We demonstrate our method on an image classification problem using ImageNet's People Subtree subset, and show that it is effective in enhancing robustness and mitigating bias in certain classes that represent vulnerable populations (e.g., female doctor of color). Our new method is able to (1) identify weak decision boundaries for such classes; (2) construct search queries for Google as well as text for generating images through DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion; and (3) show how these newly captured training samples could alleviate population bias issue. While still improving the model's overall performance considerably, we achieve a significant reduction (77.30\%) in the model's gender accuracy disparity. In addition to these improvements, we observed a notable enhancement in the classifier's decision boundary, as it is characterized by fewer weakspots and an increased separation between classes. Although we showcase our method on vulnerable populations in this study, the proposed technique is extendable to a wide range of problems and domains.",[],[],"['Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu', 'Yunhe Feng', 'Chirag Shah']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06759,Security,Knowledge Sharing via Domain Adaptation in Customs Fraud Detection.,"Knowledge of the changing traffic is critical in risk management. Customs offices worldwide have traditionally relied on local resources to accumulate knowledge and detect tax fraud. This naturally poses countries with weak infrastructure to become tax havens of potentially illicit trades. The current paper proposes DAS, a memory bank platform to facilitate knowledge sharing across multi-national customs administrations to support each other. We propose a domain adaptation method to share transferable knowledge of frauds as prototypes while safeguarding the local trade information. Data encompassing over 8 million import declarations have been used to test the feasibility of this new system, which shows that participating countries may benefit up to 2-11 times in fraud detection with the help of shared knowledge. We discuss implications for substantial tax revenue potential and strengthened policy against illicit trades.",[],[],"['Sungwon Park', 'Sundong Kim', 'Meeyoung Cha']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04837,Security,'Beach' to 'Bitch': Inadvertent Unsafe Transcription of Kids' Content on YouTube.,"Over the last few years, YouTube Kids has emerged as one of the highly competitive alternatives to television for children's entertainment. Consequently, YouTube Kids' content should receive an additional level of scrutiny to ensure children's safety. While research on detecting offensive or inappropriate content for kids is gaining momentum, little or no current work exists that investigates to what extent AI applications can (accidentally) introduce content that is inappropriate for kids. In this paper, we present a novel (and troubling) finding that well-known automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems may produce text content highly inappropriate for kids while transcribing YouTube Kids' videos. We dub this phenomenon as \emph{inappropriate content hallucination}. Our analyses suggest that such hallucinations are far from occasional, and the ASR systems often produce them with high confidence. We release a first-of-its-kind data set of audios for which the existing state-of-the-art ASR systems hallucinate inappropriate content for kids. In addition, we demonstrate that some of these errors can be fixed using language models.",[],[],"['Krithika Ramesh', 'Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh', 'Sumeet Kumar']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02142,Security,Training on the Test Set: Mapping the System-Problem Space in AI.,"Recent research efforts on adversarial ML have investigated problem-space attacks, focusing on the generation of real evasive objects in domains where, unlike images, there is no clear inverse mapping to the feature space (e.g., software). However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of problem-space attacks remain underexplored. This paper makes two major contributions. First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved semantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility. We shed light on the relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the concept of side-effect features as the byproduct of the inverse feature-mapping problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe several attacks from related literature across different domains. Second, building on our formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack on Android malware that overcomes past limitations. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android apps from 2017 and 2018 show the practical feasibility of evading a state-of-the-art malware classifier along with its hardened version. Our results demonstrate that ""adversarial-malware as a service"" is a realistic threat, as we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous adversarial applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes to generate an adversarial app. Our formalization of problem-space attacks paves the way to more principled research in this domain.",[],[],"['Fabio Pierazzi', 'Feargus Pendlebury', 'Jacopo Cortellazzi', 'Lorenzo Cavallaro']",[],[]

However, the deployment of ML models is still impaired by a lack of trust in how the best-performing ML models make predictions. The issue of lack of trust is even more acute in the uses of ML models in high-risk or safety-critical domains. eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is at the core of ongoing efforts for delivering trustworthy AI. Unfortunately, XAI is riddled with critical misconceptions, that foster distrust instead of building trust. This paper details some of the most visible misconceptions in XAI, and shows how formal methods have been used, both to disprove those misconceptions, but also to devise practically effective alternatives.",[],[],['Joao Marques-Silva'],[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02453,Security,Identifying Early Warning Signals from News Using Network Community Detection.,"From physics to engineering, biology and social science, natural and artificial systems are characterized by interconnected topologies whose features - e.g., heterogeneous connectivity, mesoscale organization, hierarchy - affect their robustness to external perturbations, such as targeted attacks to their units. Identifying the minimal set of units to attack to disintegrate a complex network, i.e. network dismantling, is a computationally challenging (NP-hard) problem which is usually attacked with heuristics. Here, we show that a machine trained to dismantle relatively small systems is able to identify higher-order topological patterns, allowing to disintegrate large-scale social, infrastructural and technological networks more efficiently than human-based heuristics. Remarkably, the machine assesses the probability that next attacks will disintegrate the system, providing a quantitative method to quantify systemic risk and detect early-warning signals of system's collapse. This demonstrates that machine-assisted analysis can be effectively used for policy and decision making to better quantify the fragility of complex systems and their response to shocks.",[],[],"['Marco Grassia', 'Manlio De Domenico', 'Giuseppe Mangioni']",[],[]

Reducing the associated energy consumption while maintaining comfortable conditions in buildings are conflicting objectives and represent a typical optimization problem that requires intelligent system design. Over the last decade, different methodologies based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been deployed to find the sweet spot between energy use in HVAC systems and suitable indoor comfort levels to the occupants. This paper performs a comprehensive and an in-depth systematic review of AI-based techniques used for building control systems by assessing the outputs of these techniques, and their implementations in the reviewed works, as well as investigating their abilities to improve the energy-efficiency, while maintaining thermal comfort conditions. This enables a holistic view of (1) the complexities of delivering thermal comfort to users inside buildings in an energy-efficient way, and (2) the associated bibliographic material to assist researchers and experts in the field in tackling such a challenge. Among the 20 AI tools developed for both energy consumption and comfort control, functions such as identification and recognition patterns, optimization, predictive control. Based on the findings of this work, the application of AI technology in building control is a promising area of research and still an ongoing, i.e., the performance of AI-based control is not yet completely satisfactory.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03757,Security,Predictive Maintenance for General Aviation Using Convolutional Transformers.,"Predictive maintenance systems have the potential to significantly reduce costs for maintaining aircraft fleets as well as provide improved safety by detecting maintenance issues before they come severe. However, the development of such systems has been limited due to a lack of publicly labeled multivariate time series (MTS) sensor data. MTS classification has advanced greatly over the past decade, but there is a lack of sufficiently challenging benchmarks for new methods. This work introduces the NGAFID Maintenance Classification (NGAFID-MC) dataset as a novel benchmark in terms of difficulty, number of samples, and sequence length. NGAFID-MC consists of over 7,500 labeled flights, representing over 11,500 hours of per second flight data recorder readings of 23 sensor parameters. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods are not well suited for capturing temporally distant relationships and propose a new architecture called Convolutional Multiheaded Self Attention (Conv-MHSA) that achieves greater classification performance at greater computational efficiency. We also demonstrate that image inspired augmentations of cutout, mixup, and cutmix, can be used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization in MTS classification. Our best trained models have been incorporated back into the NGAFID to allow users to potentially detect flights that require maintenance as well as provide feedback to further expand and refine the NGAFID-MC dataset.",[],[],"['Hong Yang', 'Aidan LaBella', 'Travis Desell']",[],[]

This may be due to the conflicting ways through which distinct Artificial Intelligence (AI) research tracks conceive of their interface with social contexts. In this paper we track the historical emergence of sociotechnical inquiry in three distinct subfields of AI research: AI Safety, Fair Machine Learning (Fair ML) and Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Autonomy. We show that for each subfield, perceptions of PIT stem from the particular dangers faced by past integration of technical systems within a normative social order. We further interrogate how these histories dictate the response of each subfield to conceptual traps, as defined in the Science and Technology Studies literature. Finally, through a comparative analysis of these currently siloed fields, we present a roadmap for a unified approach to sociotechnical graduate pedagogy in AI.",[],[],"['McKane Andrus', 'Sarah Dean', 'Thomas Krendl Gilbert', 'Nathan Lambert', 'Tom Zick']",[],[]
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13937,Security,Model AI Assignments 2022.,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great promise in robotic continuous control tasks. Nevertheless, prior research in this vein center around the centralized learning setting that largely relies on the communication availability among all the components of a robot. However, agents in the real world often operate in a decentralised fashion without communication due to latency requirements, limited power budgets and safety concerns. By formulating robotic components as a system of decentralised agents, this work presents a decentralised multiagent reinforcement learning framework for continuous control. To this end, we first develop a cooperative multiagent PPO framework that allows for centralized optimisation during training and decentralised operation during execution. However, the system only receives a global reward signal which is not attributed towards each agent. To address this challenge, we further propose a generic game-theoretic credit assignment framework which computes agent-specific reward signals. Last but not least, we also incorporate a model-based RL module into our credit assignment framework, which leads to significant improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on experimental results on Mujoco locomotion control tasks.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09207,Security,Creating Interactive Crowds with Reinforcement Learning.,"This work presents a deep reinforcement learning framework for interactive navigation in a crowded place. Our proposed approach, Learning to Balance (L2B) framework enables mobile robot agents to steer safely towards their destinations by avoiding collisions with a crowd, while actively clearing a path by asking nearby pedestrians to make room, if necessary, to keep their travel efficient. We observe that the safety and efficiency requirements in crowd-aware navigation have a trade-off in the presence of social dilemmas between the agent and the crowd. On the one hand, intervening in pedestrian paths too much to achieve instant efficiency will result in collapsing a natural crowd flow and may eventually put everyone, including the self, at risk of collisions. On the other hand, keeping in silence to avoid every single collision will lead to the agent's inefficient travel. With this observation, our L2B framework augments the reward function used in learning an interactive navigation policy to penalize frequent active path clearing and passive collision avoidance, which substantially improves the balance of the safety-efficiency trade-off. We evaluate our L2B framework in a challenging crowd simulation and demonstrate its superiority, in terms of both navigation success and collision rate, over a state-of-the-art navigation approach.",[],[],"['Mai Nishimura', 'Ryo Yonetani']",[],[]

Lightweight encryption algorithms provide security for these devices to protect data against intruders. But the limitation of using energy in lightweight block ciphers (LBCs) is one of the major challenges for ever-expanding IoT technologies. Also, these LBC are subject to Side-channel attacks, which are among the most cited threats to these ciphers. In this paper, a differential power attack (DPA) to the Midori64 block cipher is designed. According to the proposed method, an attack on the S-boxes of the first round is done to obtain half of the master key bits. Then, the S-boxes of the second round were attacked to obtain remaining the master key bits. The results confirmed that the key is ultimately obtained. With the low volume of computational complexity, we obtained the Midori block cipher key, which was considered secure, just by using 300 samples of the plaintext.

Conventional wisdom dictates that model biases arise from biased training data. As a consequence, previous works on bias mitigation largely focused on pre-processing the training data, adding penalties to prevent bias from effecting the model during training, or post-processing predictions to debias them, yet these approaches have shown limited success on hard problems such as face recognition. In our work, we discover that biases are actually inherent to neural network architectures themselves. Following this reframing, we conduct the first neural architecture search for fairness, jointly with a search for hyperparameters. Our search outputs a suite of models which Pareto-dominate all other high-performance architectures and existing bias mitigation methods in terms of accuracy and fairness, often by large margins, on the two most widely used datasets for face identification, CelebA and VGGFace2.
