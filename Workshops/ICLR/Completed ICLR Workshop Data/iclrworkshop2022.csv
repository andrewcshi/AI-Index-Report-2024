https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/4554,Transparency & Explainability,"Workshop on the Elements of Reasoning: Objects, Structure and Causality","Linear Programs (LP) are celebrated widely, particularly so in machine learning where they have allowed for effectively solving probabilistic inference tasks or imposing structure on end-to-end learning systems. Their potential might seem depleted but we propose a foundational, causal perspective that reveals intriguing intra- and inter-structure relations for LP components. We conduct a systematic, empirical investigation on general-, shortest path- and energy system LPs.",[],[],"['Sungjin Ahn', 'Wilka Carvalho', 'Klaus Greff', 'Tong He', 'Thomas Kipf', 'Francesco Locatello', 'Sindy LÃ¶we']",[],[]
https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/4555,Transparency & Explainability,"PAIR^2Struct: Privacy, Accountability, Interpretability, Robustness, Reasoning on Structured Data","Recent years have seen advances on principles and guidance relating to accountable and ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) spring up around the globe. Specifically, Data Privacy, Accountability, Interpretability, Robustness, and Reasoning have been broadly recognized as fundamental principles of using machine learning (ML) technologies on decision-critical and/or privacy-sensitive applications. On the other hand, in tremendous real-world applications, data itself can be well represented as various structured formalisms, such as graph-structured data (e.g., networks), grid-structured data (e.g., images), sequential data (e.g., text), etc. By exploiting the inherently structured knowledge, one can design plausible approaches to identify and use more relevant variables to make reliable decisions, thereby facilitating real-world deployments.",[],[],"['Hao Wang', 'Wanyu LIN', 'Hao He', 'Di Wang', 'Chengzhi Mao', 'Muhan Zhang']",[],[]

https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/4564,Security,Generalizable Policy Learning in the Physical World,"Imitation Learning uses the demonstrations of an expert to uncover the optimal policy and it is suitable for real-world robotics tasks as well. In this case, however, the training of the agent is carried out in a simulation environment due to safety, economic and time constraints. Later, the agent is applied in the real-life domain using sim-to-real methods. In this paper, we apply Imitation Learning methods that solve a robotics task in a simulated environment and use transfer learning to apply these solutions in the real-world environment. Our task is set in the Duckietown environment, where the robotic agent has to follow the right lane based on the input images of a single forward-facing camera. We present three Imitation Learning and two sim-to-real methods capable of achieving this task. A detailed comparison is provided on these techniques to highlight their advantages and disadvantages.",[],[],"['Young Min Kim', 'Sergey Levine', 'Ming Lin', 'Tongzhou Mu', 'Ashvin Nair', 'Hao Su']",[],[]
